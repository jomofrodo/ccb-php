# A NOTE TO THOSE WHO'D BOTHER TO LOOK AT THIS FILE:
#
#
# The purpose of the "robots.txt" file is to keep these directories
# from being indexed so that the average user doesn't stumble across them
# while performing searches, and those that should be accessing these
# directories will do so through the URL that requires them to register.
# Of course, having the contents of this file advertised in "comp.risks"
# diminishes its purpose.  Thanks Bertrand. ;-)
