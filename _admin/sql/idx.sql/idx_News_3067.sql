According to KNLA reports,the SPDC forces were suffering from low morale and internal dissension and that a sudden change in orders this caused them to withdraw. There are still SPDC forces in the area but most have been withdrawn and the offensive seems to have stopped. The SPDC forces suffered over 300 casualties (killed and wounded), and the KNLA have suffered 15 wounded. Of the 15 KNLA wounded, 10 were from their own land mines. Over 1000 prisoners are being used by the SPDC forces in this offensive, as porters and as human minesweepers. At least three verified deaths have occurred when prisoners stepped on land mines as they were forced to advance in front of the Burma Army troops. Escaped prisoners report many more deaths from other mine incidents and beatings by the Burma Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n IDPs:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are still over 1,500 IDPs (over 400 families), in the upper Mae Ple Do valley. They fled there after the SPDC began this offensive in August. Relief teams were able to reach them earlier, but at this time due to the occupying SPDC forces,it is not possible for teams to get through the SPDC lines. Relief teams will however, continue to find ways to reach the IDPs. These IDPs have remained in hiding and do not desire to go to Thailand as they hope to able to return to their farms and their rice crops which will soon be ready for harvest. They are hoping that the SPDC will retreat or will be unable to control this entire area. The KNLA do have some forces remaining in this area and are providing limited protection for these IDPs. The area is heavily mined and it is difficult for anyone to move at this time.\r\n','SELF','1','','','','CCB','2003-10-21');
