    <td > CCB works to support the people of Burma through prayer, evangelism,
      advocacy and action. CCB's belief is that God's love is alive in Burma and
      its light will not be put out. Though the people are suffering under an
      oppressive dictatorship, they have not given up. We have experienced the
      love and redemption of Jesus Christ and want to share this as the Lord leads
      and opens hearts.
