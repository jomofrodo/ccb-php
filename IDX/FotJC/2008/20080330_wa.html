<h2> Introduction: </h2>
<p>Dear Friends of the Wa, 
<p> This report is written by Kay Orsini who is the Volunteer Wa Coordinator in 
  Thailand. Through her efforts the Wa ministry has not only grown, it has become 
  better organized and communications have improved. We will be praying for her 
  as she goes back to the U.S. to help take care of her children and grandchildren. 
  We are grateful for her help and now need someone to take her place starting 
  in April 2008. The following is Kay’s report. 
<p>God bless you,<br>
  Dave Eubank 
<p> We thank you for continuing to care about and help the Wa people of northeastern 
  Burma<br>
  and their cousins, the Lawa of Thailand. The Wa Hills of Burma are marked on 
  some maps of Southeast Asia, but even here in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, 
  they seem very far away. Not necessarily in distance marked by miles or kilometers 
  but in accessibility. The drug trade and guns separate us from them and contribute 
  to the atmosphere of hostility and suspicion that hangs like a pall over both 
  Burma’s Special District 2 in the north (often called “Wa State”) and the southern 
  region bordering Thailand. It’s in these two areas where most Wa people live 
  in Burma. 
<p> But like water seeping through rock, God’s amazing grace gets through to the 
  Wa. In 1908 the first Wa became Christian. This year from April 7-13, Wa Christians 
  in Burma, Thailand and China will celebrate the Centenary Jubilee of the first 
  Wa baptism. Over 50,000 Wa in Burma are believers and reportedly there are over 
  100,000 in China. God is working through them and others to overcome many challenges 
  inside and outside of the Wa church. His light continues to shine among the 
  Wa and through the Wa to others around them. 
<p> Dave, Karen and family spend most of their time on foot, on relief missions 
  in the war zones of the Karen, Karenni and Shan States, serving displaced people. 
  (You will also receive their Eubank family letter about this past year, 2007). 
  Because of the Wa partnership with the Burma dictators in legitimate business 
  as well as narcotic production and trafficking, they have not been able to go 
  to the Wa areas of Burma since 2000. The Burma Army and Wa have a cease fire 
  agreement that makes it difficult to work in (Wa) Special District 2 due to 
  Burma Army oversight. So they support the Wa pastors doing outreach and then 
  go where they can (that is into the other ethnic areas where the Burma Army 
  is conducting attacks against the Karen, Karenni and Shan people. It is a Burma 
  Army policy of shoot on sight but they can move with the ethnics who can usually 
  avoid the Burma Army). 
<p> Narcotics, collusion with the dictators, and attacks on other ethnic groups 
  make the Wa an easy scapegoat. However the Wa people themselves have very little 
  choice and are but pawns in a deadly game. Animism continues to grip the people, 
  and the threat of attack by the Army of Burma’s dictators means that most Wa 
  live in uncertainty and fear. In spite of this, the church shines its light 
  of God’s love and freedom. And in spite of many obstacles, the church keeps 
  growing and the mission to the Wa continues. Thank you for your part in that 
  growth. When the Eubanks are in Thailand they meet with the Wa Christian Fellowship 
  (WCF) to pray, assess the work, make plans and encourage each other. See several 
  photos about the Wa outreach attached below and additional photos that we are 
  sending with a second email. 
<p> <span class="smalltext">Note (1): Lawa is the name used for the ethnic Wa 
  in Thailand, but Wa is the name of the language and the people-group elsewhere 
  in the region (Burma and China). There are an estimated one million Wa people 
  in the northern Wa area and China and about 200,000 in the southern area north 
  of the Thai border. In Thailand fewer than 100,000 are ethnic Lawa-- immigrants, 
  their children and grandchildren as well as descendants of the original inhabitants 
  of the northern Thailand area surrounding Chiang Mai.</span><br>
  <span class="smalltext">Note (2): The Wa Christian Fellowship (WCF) is part 
  of the 18th District of the Church of Christ of Thailand (CCT). Pastor John 
  Saniex, administrator of the Lawa Student Hostel, is a founding member of the 
  WCF and serves as secretary. He also pastors the Wa church of Chiang Mai, which 
  currently meets at the Hostel. </span>
<p>&nbsp; 
<h2> 4. Briefly describe the project (include name of the people or ethnic group 
  among whom the mission is being carried out):</h2>
<p> 1) Lawa Student Hostel - The Hostel is in Chiang Mai, Thailand, with 34 students, 
  grades 1-12, house parents - direct Presbyterian Church (USA) support – and 
  Rev. John Saniex and his wife who provide spiritual guidance and leadership 
  to the children. Thank you, Community Presbyterian Church of Vacaville, California, 
  for the salary and ministry of Wa pastor/evangelist John which are accounted 
  for by Allan Eubank. 
<p> Thanks also to the wonderful supporters of the Thai Christian Foundation (TCF) 
  and many others who joined together this year to fund the construction of a 
  new two-story permanent dormitory building. Pauline Hosek Conrad gave an initial 
  “seed” gift that made the Lawa Hostel dream possible (see financial statement 
  below). The building is an answer to the prayers of many of you and those of 
  the Lawa children themselves who prayed long and consistently. Christians in 
  many churches have helped make this project possible—with everyone working alongside 
  our Lord’s powerful Holy Spirit. The building is 9,872.3 square feet and cost 
  $199,106.93 or $20.20 per square foot including fill, pilings and construction. 
  The Hostel is under the cooperative ownership of the Church of Christ of Thailand. 
<p> We also feel deep appreciation for the Christians who donated the essential 
  Hostel truck seven years ago. We pray that in the future, Lawa hostel students 
  will become real Christian leaders who reach out with the good news of Jesus 
  Christ across borders and across issues dividing Wa and other ethnic peoples 
  in the Burma-China-Thailand region. </p>
<p>2) Evangelists – There are eight evangelists working full time in northern 
  Wa District that we support, six directly and two indirectly. Six are teacher-evangelists--five 
  based at the Ying Phaung hostel and school and one at Cao Tie village, the old 
  hostel site. One part-time evangelist-pastor travels to both sides of the border 
  and also on Wa evangelistic trips to the northern Wa District. Another Wa pastor-evangelist 
  travels the Thai side of the border and sharing the gospel with the Lawa people.</p>
<p>3) Evangelism trips –The Wa evangelists are engaged in teaching and preaching 
  at various villages in the northern Special District and in the southern region. 
  There are Lawa pastor trips across the border to preach and teach and provide 
  medical and relief supplies to poor Wa villagers. See photos of baptisms in 
  Na Kawng Mu and Ying Phaung, Burma. There is regular travel by Lawa evangelists 
  to Lawa villages in Thailand border areas. </p>
<p>4) Northern District Ying Phaung Hostel and School – 31 poor Wa children live 
  and study at Ying Phaung Christian Hostel and School in the northern Wa District 
  near the border with China. Some have lost one or both parents and some are 
  from poverty-stricken families. At least 32 more children attend school during 
  the day totaling 63 children touched. The hostel is in its sixth year, thanks 
  to the Kachin and Wa missionaries who are faithfully serving to witness for 
  Christ in a poverty-stricken area. Through special gifts, we have been able 
  to provide support for 3-6 months of the year on average (in addition to the 
  teacher-evangelist salaries) and have depended on the Wa church, the UN World 
  Food Program and the grace of God for the balance. See further details below. 
</p>
<p>5) Medical care – In the past, we have helped to provide medical care for Wa 
  people. The Lawa church provided help for some individuals who could not afford 
  their hospital bills. Just recently in February, some Lawa pastors and church 
  members travelled across the border to a poor Wa village, Na Kawng Mu, in the 
  southern region and brought with them warm clothing, blankets and<br>
  medicines for the most common illnesses. </p>
<p> 6) Christian Literature – The work to translate, check, publish, and distribute 
  a complete Wa Bible, Old and New Testament, is ongoing. The 2006 Bible is now 
  being revised. Wa Christian leaders in the northern District asked that the 
  revision be published by April 2008 in time for the 100-year celebration of 
  the first Wa baptism. Copies of the draft at its current stage are being printed 
  and taken to the celebration even as Wa pastor-readers continue reading and 
  checking the manuscript. Evangelism material and Sunday School materials in 
  the Wa language are being distributed in the southern Wa region by other mission 
  groups as well. 
<p>&nbsp; 
<h2>5. Major activities of the past 12 months:</h2>
<p> 1) Lawa Student Hostel in Chiang Mai—The hostel is thriving with 34 young 
  people. They mostly come to Chiang Mai from villages and towns in northern Thailand 
  for a good public education and Christian nurture in a bi-lingual (Wa-Thai) 
  language environment. When volunteers are available, they teach English and 
  computers on the wonderful computers the Rotary donated. The new building is 
  much bigger and cleaner than the old bamboo structures. Now they don’t have 
  to worry about snakes getting in and hiding under their beds! If you come to 
  Chiang Mai, be sure to stop by and meet the students, the hostel parents, Rev. 
  John Saniex and his wife, Sopha. It’s thrilling to join the young people in 
  worship and singing at various times during the week. Evening worship is at 
  7:00 pm and is often led by students. Here, it is clear that Christ is Lord 
  of the nations. See photo , “Under Construction” showing David and Karen with 
  their son, Peter, touring the building with Pastor John. We celebrated its completion 
  on Dec. 15th (further details below). 
<p> 2) Rotary -- Rotary Clubs were instrumental in giving special facilities for 
  the new hostel building, such as the outdoor sanitation system, the four adjacent 
  outdoor bathrooms, and lots of needed equipment. Adele Anderson coordinated 
  the matching grant application with Rotary Clubs in Tempe, Arizona; Walla Walla, 
  Washington; and Chiang Mai, Thailand; and with Rotary Foundation. See the photo 
  of the Lawa Hostel children singing their “Thank You” at the Chiang Mai Rotary 
  Club meeting. Another photo, “Partners in the dream,” shows Allan Eubank, Pastor 
  John Saniex and Adele Anderson in front of the nearly finished building. 
<p> 3) Ying Phaung Hostel -- The food supply for the children and staff at Ying 
  Phang hostel is still not secure. When we met in January this year in Chiang 
  Mai with Roi Ji, the Hostel Director, she brought news of a Wa District government 
  initiative to construct another school and hostel building on the 10 acre site. 
  She believes they will bring piped water to the hostel when they complete the 
  building—so it’s better not ask for help to increase the hostel water storage 
  capacity at this time. In case the UN World Food Program ends the school rice-feeding 
  project, Roi Ji wants to put a plan for food-sufficiency in place now. The hostel 
  grows a vegetable garden to help feed themselves and corn for themselves and 
  for their five pigs and some chickens. She said they need five more pigs and 
  also fencing for the crops to keep cows, buffaloes and other animals out. They 
  lost half their corn crop last year to animals and she is concerned that the 
  tea trees they planted for a future cash crop (3 years to maturity) are getting 
  damaged as well. They would like to fence the entire area but do not have the 
  funds for that. Would you pray with us for food self-sufficiency for the Ying 
  Phaung Hostel children and staff? Thank you. 
<p> Dr. Thein Lwin, the Burmese educator based in Chiang Mai, and his supporters 
  have sent funds this year to Ying Phaung School for student school supplies 
  and a large gift for library books as well as funds for teacher training and 
  scholarships for four 4th grade Ying Phaung graduates to continue their studies 
  at Mayao School. We invited him to join our meeting with Roi Ji for coordination 
  of aid to the hostel and school. 
<p> 4) Evangelism in northern Wa Special District-- The six full-time evangelist/teachers 
  based at Ying Phaung continue their work sharing the gospel, strengthening believers 
  and teaching. A new Christian worker, Nyi Rung, has been called to serve as 
  pastor-evangelist and is supported by the Lawa Church in Chiang Mai. The Lawa 
  Church is working hard to support missions, as they are able. The Ying Phaung 
  evangelists focus their efforts for the most part on spiritual nurture of the 
  hostel children and the school children. Roi Ji said they have confidence in 
  our Lord that the children’s faith will help lead their families to Him. They 
  pray that when the children complete their education, they will be able to nurture 
  others and become bridges for their people to live better lives through Christ. 
  See photo of Christmas baptisms at Ying Phaung. Eight adults and four children 
  were baptized this time. 
<p> 5) Evangelism in southern Wa areas—Across the Chiang Mai Province border with 
  Burma near Chiang Dao is an area of Wa village resettlements. Some time ago, 
  the Wa authorities forcibly relocated large numbers of Wa from their villages 
  in the north down to the southern border areas. Consequently, there are a number 
  of very poor villages just across the border. An 80 year-old Lahu pastor has 
  been ministering to people in the Tambol (township) of Na Kawng Mu (most Wa 
  understand some Lahu language), but not long ago he came to see Ajan Banjong, 
  a Thai-Lawa pastor on the Thai side of the border to beg for a Wa pastor to 
  come and preach the gospel. He said the people are very thirsty for the good 
  news of Jesus—and he wanted them to hear it in their “heart” language. Pastor 
  Banjong is on fire to work with them—though they are just out of reach. So he 
  talked to Pastor John about an evangelism visit across the border. They talked 
  to Allan about their plans and prayed and it happened. They pre-coordinated 
  with the Thai border police. Two pastors went with Pastor John and some other 
  Lawa Christians. They said you should have seen the excitement on the peoples’ 
  faces when they finally arrived with the truckload of blankets, warm clothes 
  (international church had a clothing drive for them) and medicines. See the 
  photo of a new believer’s baptism during their stay and the photo of the Na 
  Kawng Mu church family. 
<p> There are 22 families in the Na Kawng Mu Church and some 50 families in the 
  whole village of Man Siang (named after their home village up north). They are 
  eager to share the gospel with their fellow villagers, but their helper, the 
  80 year old Lahu missionary pastor, is about to retire. He has been teaching 
  a dedicated layman who loves the Lord and is ready to start Bible teaching. 
  Pastor Banjong, on the Thai side of the border, wants to take on some evangelism 
  duties and to structure a training program for the lay teacher if he can cross 
  the border on a regular basis. Would you pray with us about support for this 
  possibility and for the safety of border crossings? It may take a budget of 
  about $100 a month to do this evangelism project. 
<p>&nbsp; 
<h2>6. Changes in personnel, short-term objectives or emphases since beginning 
  of the project or last report:</h2>
<p> 1) The Lawa Christian Hostel in Chiang Mai is a wonderfully vital place. We 
  praise God that this year the new 2-story permanent dormitory building was completed. 
  On 15 December we celebrated in a big way with a community-wide event for 300 
  people. Some Lawa people attending said they wept with happiness when they first 
  came and saw what a wonderful building God had given the Wa people. The Moderator 
  of the Church of Christ of Thailand (CCT) cut the red ribbon opening the new 
  building. We had worship, Lawa and Thai singing and dancing, buffet lunch, a 
  Christmas celebration in the afternoon and gifts for the children. School teachers, 
  local government leaders and community representatives joined in the celebration. 
  Hostel ties with the local community have been strengthened. 
<p> 2) The WCF invited youth leaders to form a Lawa Youth Council in 2006. The 
  Youth hope to develop leadership skills, to mentor the younger members and to 
  lead the Lawa (Wa) community into challenging opportunities working with Wa 
  Christians in other countries of the region. Miss Uraiwan Kornlao, who is president 
  of the Lawa Hostel students and just graduated from high school, will go with 
  other Lawa Church members to Mong Mao, Burma, for the Centenary Christian Jubilee 
  in April. We hope she’ll bring back a broader vision of the Wa Church to share 
  with the other students. 
<p> Chiang Mai International School students have come to the hostel to help on 
  maintenance projects and to teach computer skills to the children for their 
  community service requirement. They teamed with the Lawa students to paint the 
  old office. See the photo of several international students (standing) giving 
  tips to the Lawa student on a hostel computer provided in 2006 through Rotary 
  funds. 
<p> 3) Please pray with us for Wa Christian workers in northern and southern Wa 
  areas of Burma and in Thailand, as well. See the paragraph above on evangelism 
  work across the border in the southern Wa region. Wa Christian workers many 
  times must continue forward on a wing and a prayer from fellow Christians around 
  the world because of lack of funding, strong local non-Christian opposition 
  to their work and internal divisions in the Wa church. 
<p> 4) I, Kay Orsini, volunteer Wa coordinator, will be relocating to the US at 
  the end of March to spend time with my new grandchildren. We are seeking one 
  or two Christian volunteers to continue the coordination of Wa work. I also 
  taught English at the neighborhood school a few hours a week. Volunteers can 
  be short term or long term; retired, in mid-life or just out of college. This 
  vital Wa Outreach alongside the Eubank team is very interesting and fulfilling. 
<p>&nbsp;
