 style="font-size: 12pt;">FLIGHT OF THE JUNGLE CHICKEN: April 2005</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">On the last mission as we were crossing a
river to get back I was filled with joy at the thought of all the
people who have made it possible for this work to go on. I wanted to
see and thank each of you. We do hope we can and know that finally in
heaven we will.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">Training and Missions: From October 2004
though February 2005 we trained 18 new relief teams inside <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Burma</st1:country-region> and went with them to bring help
to internally displaced people (IDPs), in the ethnic areas of <st1:place
 w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Burma</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
During this time the Burma Army attacked the Karen and Karenni people
displacing over 8,000 villagers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">One of the things that struck me most was the
positive attitude of the people and their resiliency. They smiled,
joked and tried to give us food they had been saving.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">A group of five young Karen nurses who
traveled with us were also amazing. We had to walk over many mountains
and these ladies did this in rubber slippers. It was cold every night
and they all huddled together in one group, sharing blankets and living
no better than the IDPs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While moving, we were
often very close to SPDC outposts and patrols. One morning I asked the
nurses if they were afraid of the Burma Army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes,
we are very afraid", they answered. "But we want to help our people, so
we try". The IDPs told us, "We do not put our faith in the world or any
nation; we have our faith in God, so we have hope". They keep their
belongings packed every day and are ready to flee at a moments notice,
but they have not given up.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">G</span></font><span style="">race: Before
this mission while we were still in a training site for the relief
teams, our</span> 2 year old daughter, Suuzanne, became very sick with
malaria (pf), which has a high mortality rate especially among infants.
The medicine we had did not work. We were in many days by foot and with
the Burma Army patrolling the border, all walks out are slow at best.
We knew of a medicine that if available could help Suuzanne, but we did
not have it. Early in the morning on the third day of her sickness, I
woke up at <st1:time w:st="on" minute="30" hour="16">4:30</st1:time>
and with my flashlight read from Psalms. I read the words, &#8220;Be still
and know that I am God.&#8221; I crawled under the mosquito net where Karen
and our two girls were sleeping and prayed for Baby Suu. As I prayed I
felt this voice say.&#8221; I will take care of her&#8221;. I knew it was God and
felt peace even though I did not know if that meant He would take care
of her in Heaven or here on earth with us. Later that morning a Karen
evangelist came walking into our camp with a group of Karen bible
school students. They gathered around me and prayed for Baby Suu&#8217;s
healing. Within 10 minutes of their prayer, a Karen medic walked into
the camp and said he heard that baby Suu had a bad form of Malaria and
that he had brought the one drug we did not have. He treated her and by
the end of the week Baby Suu was up running around like a human cannon
ball, very much alive. We know that neither we nor our children will
live on this earth forever but we are grateful for every day we do have
as a family.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="black" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;">GLC Program: </span></font>While
Dave went with the relief teams to the areas under attack, Karen went
on a &#8220;Good Life Club&#8221; mission to villagers and IDPs in an area the
Burma Army was not attacking. Her team included, Sahale, Suu , my
sister Laurie, Atee and a team of Karen and Karenni medics, teachers
and relief workers. They<font color="black"><span style="color: black;">
went to reach out to people of all faiths and were able to share
together with Karen Christians, Buddhists, and Animists.&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="black" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;">In terms of our program, the
premise of the Good Life Club (GLC) comes from Jesus' words in the
Bible (John 10:10) "The thief does not come except to steal, and to
kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that
they may have it more abundantly."&nbsp;I believe that Jesus fulfills his
promises. All can receive abundant life regardless of their situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
In the morning our team sang songs in Karen, Burmese and English
followed by a Bible lesson about the life of Ruth using a flannel graph
story, emphasizing choices, thankfulness, and being part of the family
of God.&nbsp;In the afternoon the team used puppet shows to teach basic
health care, village sanitation and personal hygiene.&nbsp;In the evening we
used the computer and solar charged batteries to show the Jesus Film in
Karen language, and when we had adequate power, The Jungle Book cartoon.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="black" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="black" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;">Boundaries: For us, God&#8217;s
boundaries have to do with temptations we are too weak to resist or
duties we are not to assume. We may ask God, why can&#8217;t I get close to
that, or why can&#8217;t we do that? God knows our limitations and has a duty
for each of us and as we trust and obey we begin to see that God has
put our boundaries in pleasant places.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="black" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="black" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;">We thank God for our team here;
Amy Davisson is heading up the team </span></font>which now includes
Dr. Michelle and Ruth Vandenhautte-Medical doctor and teacher, Austin
Anderson-administration, Nathan Collins-Logistics/Finance, Alex Rodgers
, Marci Haigh, the Nash&#8217;s and Austin House-coordinators. God has
blessed us with these wonderful people. <span style="">Our team will
grow by one as Karen is now pregnant with our third child.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">We are made stronger by your love and
intercession for us.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt;">God bless you and thank you, Dave, Karen,
Sahale, Suu and one on the way.</span></font></p>
