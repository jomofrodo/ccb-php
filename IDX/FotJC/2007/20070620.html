<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p> Thank you for all you do for us and with us. We are now traveling in the USA 
  and Europe to say thanks, see as many of you as we can and report on the situation 
  in Burma. We just finished two weeks of meetings in Washington D.C. We were 
  part of a ethnic delegation from Burma, (the Ethnic Nationalities Council), 
  and had the opportunity to develop new relationships and meet with members of 
  Congress, the State Department, Department of Defense and Non Governmental Organizations. 
  We were also able to meet and brief Mrs. Bush in the White House. Mrs. Bush 
  is leading a women's caucus on Burma and has a deep concern for the people there. 
  Congressman Joseph Pitts and Karin Finkler helped to facilitate these meetings 
  and we were also greatly helped by Laurie Dawson of the Free Burma Housewives, 
  George Tronsrue, Tom Van Dyke, Jen Quigley and the people of the US Campaign 
  for Burma. </p>

<p>We are now enroute to Norway after a brief visit to see good friends and churches 
  (DCC), in Denmark. In Norway we will be testifying about the situation in Burma 
  along with a Burman and Ethnic delegation. This is a conference hosted by Partners 
  Relief and Development Norway, in conjunction with the Falstad Center, a Memorial 
  and Human Rights center dedicated to those who resisted and suffered under Nazi 
  rule during World War II. The Dialogue Conference on Burma will be held here 
  and we are grateful to Partners for this opportunity to take part. 
<p>Through out this time we have been blessed by God to have such good friends 
  helping us to open doors. We could not do any of this without you and thank 
  you so much for all you do and especially for your prayers. We will be back 
  in the USA in July and will travel thorough Colorado, California, Oregon, Washington 
  and Alaska. We hope to see as many of you as we can and for those we miss, we 
  are sorry and hope to see when we next are in the US. 
<p>Mostly this letter is to say thanks for praying and for caring about the people 
  of Burma. Also we want to testify to God in action, meaning we have no idea 
  of what is next or how meetings will really happen, but God keeps connecting 
  us with people who care. 
<p> Thanks and God bless you, 
<p>Dave, Karen, Sahale, Suuzanne, Peter Eliya Eubank and Amy Davisson<br>
