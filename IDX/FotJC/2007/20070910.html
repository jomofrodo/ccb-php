        <p>Dear friends, </p>
        <p> We are back in Thailand and getting ready to go into the field for 
          continuing missions. We were overwhelmed by the love you all gave us 
          and the support - spiritual, moral, and material. 
        <p> <br>
          Thanks for all the good talks, walks, runs, hunts, mountain climbs, 
          horse, boat, bike and plane rides and the opportunities to enjoy you 
          all and the nature of America, Denmark and Norway. We are glad to be 
          back but as we boarded the plane felt like we were leaving a pieces 
          of our heart with you there. 
        <p> We are so glad to have such a wonderful family and team in you all 
          and now before we go back inside we want to share the things we learned 
          on this trip. 
        <p> First are some of the many lessons we learned from you while in the 
          USA: 
        <p> 1) Our country is full of wonderful people from coast to coast and 
          many people in our Government are dedicated, warm hearted, clear thinking 
          people who do their best to serve and need our prayers.<br>
          2) The Church is a great light of truth, mercy, love and hope for our 
          country and the world.<br>
          3) We want to be part of the Kingdom of God that is everywhere in the 
          world and shines in the darkest places. We do not want to be about building 
          our own Kingdoms or looking for "market share". We want to be about 
          building God's Kingdom. Then we are free to enjoy this life and be useful 
          for God.<br>
          4) We want to forgive and bless our enemies. On this trip a friend- 
          Doug Yoder, asked me, "When Pharaoh sent out the edict to kill all the 
          Jewish boys, who saved Moses?" ... then he said, "Pharaoh's daughter 
          saved Moses. the daughter of the enemy." It reminded me that all people 
          are God's children and God works through even our enemies. Nothing is 
          higher than His purpose or evil enough to overcome God's ability to 
          bring good from all circumstances. When we ask God to bless our enemies 
          we are freed form the burden of offense, resentment and worry. I know 
          for me too, one of the first ways that God has blessed me in my own 
          life is to show me my own sin. <br>
          5) And from Franklin Graham, who I met on a dirt airstrip in Alaska 
          - "God likes it when we talk well about His Son...always work for the 
          eternal and pray that all your team members follow Jesus"<br>
          .<br>
          Lessons we learned in Burma and wanted to share this time in America: 
        <p> 1) We want to thank God for all things at all times and see what God 
          does.<br>
          2) We don't want to make any decision based on comfort or fear.<br>
          3) When making a decision as a group, we try to offer up all opinions 
          to God and commit to obey God no matter the result. When we do that 
          we find we are led in the same way. <br>
          4) We do not serve a cause, we serve our Lord Jesus. I was reminded 
          and convicted of this by our chief Karen medic Eliya Samson. 
        <p> <br>
          For these and many other lessons and encouragements that each of you 
          gave us, thank you. May God bless us all and lead us back together again. 
        <p><br>
          We love and pray for you, 
        <p><br>
          Dave, Karen, Sahale, Suuzanne, Peter Eliya and all of the team here.
