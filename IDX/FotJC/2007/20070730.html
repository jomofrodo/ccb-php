<p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>We are now traveling back in the US after finishing a conference on Burma in 
  Norway. It was a good meeting hosted by Partners Relief and Development at the 
  Falstad Memorial and Human Rights Center which is dedicated to those who resisted 
  and suffered under Nazi rule during World War II. We were honored by the presence 
  of one 93 year old Norwegian veteran of the resistance who encouraged us all. 
  The Dialogue Conference on Burma was held there with representatives from the 
  Norwegian Government, Partners, Pro- democracy and ethnic groups from Burma-Win 
  Min, Khin Ohmar, Aung Maat and David Taw, Christian Solidarity Worldwide-Ben 
  Rogers and Earth Rights International- Matt Smith and us.
<p>Thanks to all our dear friends in Partners who organized the conference and 
  took good care of all of us- we love you! Below are photos of the conference, 
  some from this trip and an earlier photo with the family, the delegation and 
  Congressman Joseph Pitts who organized the Washington D. C trip. Again- thank 
  you so much. The girls sang a Karen blessing song at some of the meetings in 
  Washington D.C. and Norway and it was good to see them running around the Capitol 
  of the US and mountains of Norway and America.
<p>We will now continue this trip in Colorado, California, Washington and Alaska 
  while keeping touch with the FBR relief teams in Burma. When we hear of ongoing 
  attacks against the ethnic people of Burma it makes us want to be back with 
  the people there and we request prayer for the people under attack. We do look 
  forward to going back, but we want to be with you here and are very happy to 
  be able to visit some of you, meet new friends and enjoy the nature of our country. 
  We we look forward to seeing those of you that we can and to thanking you, reporting 
  and catching up on your lives.
<p>God bless you, Dave, Karen, Sahale, Suuzanne, and Peter Eliya Eubank
<p>Greetings also from Laurie Dawson, Amy Davisson, Hosannah Valentine, and Kiryn 
  Johnson who are also here in the US; and Nathan Collins, Belinda Wheeler, Matt 
  Blauer, Mitch Ryan and Alex Rodgers who are helping in Thailand.
