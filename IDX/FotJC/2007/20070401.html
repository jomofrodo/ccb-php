  Friend who survived a Landmine</span></span>
<p><span class="bodyCopy">Dear friends,</span>
<p><span class="bodyCopy">We spent most of the past year in the areas under attack 
  by the Burma Army. Over 25,000 people are newly displaced and attacks continue. 
  Thanks to your help, we now have 29 fulltime relief teams bringing emergency 
  help and love to people in the war zones of Burma. They shine a light on the 
  actions of the dictators’ army and help to build up ethnic leaders united to 
  serve their people. Thanks for being with us in this.<p>
  Through all of this we are sustained by your love, support and prayers. We are 
  also sustained by God’s word and one line in Psalm 23 has been especially meaningful 
  to us. We hope it is useful to you:</span>
<p><span class="bodyCopy"> <i>“He prepares a table for me in the presence of my 
  enemies”</i></span>
<p><span class="bodyCopy">We want to enjoy times in life without enemies or those 
  who misunderstand us but that is often not the reality. We are faced with the 
  choice of whether we will appreciate what God has for us and focus on that, 
  or always be looking over our shoulder. Being with the people who are under 
  attack, living a full life with our team members, thanking God for the things 
  we have and can do is a gift and a challenge.</span>
<p><span class="bodyCopy">May God give us all the faith we need to appreciate 
  His gifts and to live with joy and freedom.</span>
<p><span class="bodyCopy">God bless you,</span>
<p><span class="bodyCopy"> Dave, Karen, Sahale, Suuzanne, Peter Eliya Eubank and 
  all the team here.</span>
