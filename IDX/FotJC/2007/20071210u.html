<p> Karen’s Christmas Story:<br>
  Last night Dave and I discussed this year’s Christmas plans for our family. 
  We are at our jungle training site in the Karen State of Burma where we have 
  conducted a relief mission/leadership training program for the last 4 years. 
  It is October and the beginning of the dry-cool season. This is the best time 
  of the year to move people and supplies both for training and for the relief 
  missions to villagers displaced from their homes by the Burma Army. In this 
  way this will be the seventh year we have spent Christmas and New Years holidays 
  in the jungle. 
<p> <br>
  Despite being war torn communities, the Karen people amaze me with their ‘abundant’ 
  celebrations of Christmas. It actually starts on the last night of November 
  with a celebration called Sweet December. A festive meal, singing, and prayer 
  service, usually around a bonfire at midnight welcomes in the month of December 
  and the Christmas season. Because the Karen were among the first people in Burma 
  to welcome Christ into their hearts, the Christians (over 30% of the Karen are 
  Christian) have a strong history of sharing their faith both among their own 
  people and throughout Burma. Traveling Christmas programs are an integral part 
  of church life and groups pass and meet each other in villages throughout the 
  month of December. In a region devoid of modern transportation it is amazing 
  how far and wide the message of Jesus’ birth is spread in one month on foot 
  through the jungle. Upon the third week of December the festivities reach a 
  new level as whole villages begin to plan their Christmas parties. Unlike my 
  experience of a gathering primarily with family members, the village church 
  prepares for a grand community celebration including multiple church services, 
  breakfast, sports day including prizes and party favors, and an evening program 
  open to not only the whole village but to neighboring villages as well. The 
  most amazing thing is that this ‘Christmas Day’ event doesn’t necessarily happen 
  on December 25th as all the neighboring villages also prepare their own Christmas 
  celebrations and are careful not to overlap with one already planned somewhere 
  else. So, in this corner of the globe where almost every definition of ‘abundance’ 
  has been denied, Christmas is bountiful. But unlike my childhood picture of 
  a tree overflowing with gifts, this scene is overflowing with people and relationships. 
  All day during the celebration, as both Christians and non-Christians stop work, 
  eat, play and rest together, as well as on the subsequent days visiting neighboring 
  villages for their programs. The second of our two jungle homes is in the largest 
  of a group of three villages. We have typically celebrated Christmas there four 
  times each year including our own western family version. The treasure of this 
  time is certainly not in goods that they can give to each other, but in time 
  and presence which is quite similar to the original gift of Jesus’ birth to 
  the world. 
<p> <br>
  And yet, ironically, despite having experienced hearty Karen Christmases during 
  the past few years I was feeling more and more depressed as I realized that 
  due to the timing of the relief training and follow-on missions starting in 
  mid-December and the length of travel time to and from the hide-sites to help 
  IDPs, the children and I would be separated from Dave on Christmas Day, December 
  25th. In fact, none of us would even be at our own house as the children and 
  I would still be on our Good Life Club School Tour, traveling among small villages 
  and displaced persons sites. This is always a good and fruitful time, but not 
  the special or ‘set-apart’ atmosphere I looked forward to at Christmas. So, 
  despite all the ‘abundance' I knew in my mind about the Karen celebration, I 
  had a hard time swallowing the pill of how Christmas was going to look this 
  year. The cultural trappings of decorations, special food, a tree, holiday music, 
  scented candles, etc. and most significant, being together as a family were 
  so special that I did my best to continue them even at our jungle home, as well 
  as participating in the village festivities. But last night the thought of arriving 
  at December 25th without any of these things was quite painful. It felt like 
  something dear was being torn away and all the joy stored up for that day would 
  be lost. 
<p> <br>
  And yet, as time passed, I was strangely comforted by a basic truth that seemed 
  to hold power enough to turn the tide of my emotions. Christmas is the celebration 
  of the birth of Jesus and in all honesty, I don’t need special smells, tastes, 
  sounds, decorations or even members of my family to welcome the birth of a child. 
  I have celebrated that ‘Jesus is the reason for the season’ every year of my 
  life yet never without any accompanying traditions. So now, what if this year, 
  on Christmas day, the birth of Jesus is truly all we have to think about? Is 
  it special enough to be a joyful celebration all by itself? This was a striking 
  thought and in God’s deep way He spoke to me saying, “It is the core of your 
  faith, and you will see, it is enough”. I felt ashamed at my great dependence 
  on the temporal to add meaning to the divine and thankful for God’s grace in 
  my lack of appreciation for the pure gift of His Son. 
<p> <br>
  In all truth, even after the revelation of the night, I still woke up the following 
  morning to a gray cloud in my mind’s eye about the Christmas conversation and 
  remembered that I needed to write this article about ‘Christmas in the Jungle’. 
  I had previously started writing on a different theme, a less personal comparison 
  between Eastern and Western celebrations, but the conviction to give something 
  ‘real’ and genuine was stronger, and despite opening the window for all to read 
  about my spiritual shortcomings, I felt there was greater power in sharing the 
  truth. Now, several hours and one Christmas story finished, I can joyfully testify 
  that in describing how the Karen communities fluidly move the date of their 
  celebrations around I am content to celebrate our family Christmas on New Years’ 
  Day and to let Jesus come, by Himself, as the gift, on His birthday, December 
  25th. As I have experienced that Emmanuel comes to us every day of the year, 
  in all our joys and trials, may your Christmas be filled with his abundant power 
  and love. God is with us! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!<br>
  Love, Karen
