  <p> The ethnic people of Burma as well as the Burman people continue their struggle 
    for basic human rights, democracy, and freedom. Dictators have ruled Burma 
    since 1962 using force to relocate entire communities and implementing a brutal 
    . four cuts. strategy to silence all dissent. Since the bloody crushing of 
    the 1988 democracy movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burma Army has intensified 
    its attacks on all the people, but especially the ethnic groups who still 
    resist their rule. Due to the oppression of the dictators of Burma there are 
    approximately 2 million people inside Burma who have been displaced from their 
    homes. For most displaced ethnic Burmans, approximately 1 million, relocation 
    has been by force in order to make more land available for the regime. s business 
    projects. These displaced Burmans live in or near large urban centers firmly 
    under the regime. s control. </p>
  <p> For the ethnic minorities who comprise over 40 percent of Burma. s population, 
    the situation is much worse. In the minority areas such as the Karen, Karenni, 
    and Shan states, up to 1 million people have been forced to leave their homes 
    with only what they can carry and live in relocation sites where their freedom 
    is severely restricted and their treatment brutal. In the Karen and Karenni 
    states alone, over 200,000 are languishing in these sites. The villagers. 
    livestock are usually confiscated and their villages are burned to the ground. 
    Many areas are then mined to prevent villagers from returning. In some cases 
    the villagers are not allowed to go to a relocation site, but are attacked 
    by the Burma Army, murdered, raped, chased into the jungle along with having 
    their villages burned down. </p>
  <p> The regime. s stated purpose is to "crush all resistance" and to "punish" 
    the ethnic groups. The result of this scorched-earth policy is that many have 
    fled their homes or the brutal conditions of the relocation sites. These people 
    (over 400,000 in Karen and Karenni States) are currently hiding in the jungle 
    along the Thai-Burma border. They are in need of security, medical care, clothing, 
    school supplies, moral encouragement and spiritual support. </p>
  <p> Pictured on this page is a burnt IDP settlement that used to be home to 
    4,000 people. The site was attacked and destroyed by the Burma Army on April 
    4, 2000. For many who have fled this place, it is not the first time they 
    have had their houses burned and their communities destroyed. Pray for an 
    end to the terrible destruction. </p>
