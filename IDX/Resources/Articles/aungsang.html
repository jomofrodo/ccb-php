  <hr>
  <p> Aung San Suu Kyi is the winner of a Nobel Peace Prize and leader of the 
    democratically elected political party in Burma, the National League for Democracy 
    (NLD). The military regime never recognized the results of the elections held 
    eleven years ago that were overwhelmingly in support of the NLD. </p>
  <P>Aung San Suu Kyi was under house arrest for six years, released in 1995. 
    In the years following she has not been allowed outside of the city. She stays 
    in Burma and is a symbol of hope for the people that Burma will one day see 
    peace and freedom. In August 2000, Aung San Suu Kyi and some of her fellow 
    party members attempted to drive out of Rangoon to visit party members in 
    other cities and were stopped just outside Rangoon by police. They remained 
    there for nine days, being blocked from continuing, but refusing to return 
    to Rangoon. The government ended the standoff by forcing her group back to 
    Rangoon. In September 2000 she attempted to leave Rangoon again, this time 
    by train, on party business. The railway officials denied her request to buy 
    a ticket, saying there were none available. The next day she and other party 
    officials tried again. After waiting all day and into the night, they were 
    forcibly removed from the train station by police. </P>
  <P>Many reports said police removed Aung San Suu Kyi and others by physically 
    restraining them and placing pieces of cloth soaked with chloroform over their 
    mouths. After this incident the military officially placed Aung San Suu Kyi 
    under house arrest again. Most of her coworkers in the National League for 
    Democracy are in jail. News sources in January 2001 reported talks between 
    the military regime and Aung San Suu Kyi. Please pray for peace and freedom 
    and an end to the unjust imprisonment of political party members and an end 
    to the atrocities against anyone in opposition to the current powers in Burma. 
  </P>
