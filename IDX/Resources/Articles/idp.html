        <h2> <b>Internally Displaced People of Burma</b> </h2>
        <p> A tragedy that can be stopped... </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p> Due to the oppression of the dictators of Burma there are approximately 
          2million people inside Burma who have been displaced from their homes. 
          For most displaced ethnic Burmans, (about 1 million), the dictatorship 
          has relocated them by force or threat of force in order to make more 
          land available for the regime’s business projects. Most of these displaced 
          live in or near large urban centers firmly under the regime’s control 
        </p>
        <p> For the ethnic minorities the situation is much worse. In the minority 
          areas such as the Karen, Karenni and Shan states, up to 1 million people 
          have been forced to leave their homes and live in relocation sites were 
          their freedom is severely restricted and their treatment brutal. In 
          the minority areas the dictatorship has forced people to leave their 
          villages with only what they can carry, they are then forced to move 
          to a relocation site. The villagers’ livestock are usually confiscated 
          and their villages burned to the ground. Many areas are then mined to 
          prevent villagers from returning. In some cases the villagers are not 
          given a choice of going to a concentration site, but are attacked by 
          the Burma army, their villages burned, and their people murdered or 
          chased into the jungle. </p>
        <p> The regime’s stated purpose is to "crush all resistance" and to" punish" 
          the ethnic groups. The result of this scorched-earth policy is that 
          many have fled either their homes or the brutal conditions of the relocation 
          sites. These people (for example in the Karen state, over 200,000), 
          are currently hiding in the jungle along the Thai-Burma border. They 
          are in need of security, medical care, clothing , school supplies, moral 
          encouragement and spiritual support. </p>
        <p> In response to this ongoing emergency, the Ethnic groups have organized 
          teams of medics, teachers, and church workers to send relief to the 
          Internally Displaced Persons. </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> Teams carry rice, medicine, and educational supplies to try to meet 
            the IDP’s immediate needs. The teams </p>
          <p> minister to all IDPs, regardless of race, religion, or political 
            affiliation. On one team, a pastor reported that, "all the people 
            were glad to see us but were very afraid to stay and listen to us, 
            so we told them ‘don’t be afraid, we are not soldiers or politicians, 
            we are angels sent from God to help you. God loves you and wants to 
            help you. You can’t depend on the foreigners, finally you can not 
            depend on us, you can only depend on God!’ " </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> The IDPs are grateful for any help and one old man said, "Thank you 
          for caring, we know the world has not forgotten us. Please come back 
          soon." While the IDPs asked for more help especially for IDPs deeper 
          inside Burma, they were terrified of being discovered by dictatorship 
          troops (State Peace and Development Council) or to be later discovered 
          as having been in contact with outside supporters. This atmosphere of 
          terror was due to the previous experiences of these IDPs. In this area 
          SPDC troops have systematically burned villages, murdered villagers, 
          raped and tortured them, and slaughtered their livestock. In cases where 
          villages are not destroyed, the villagers live under the constant scrutiny 
          of SPDC troops and are subject to forced labor and random punishment. 
        </p>
        <p> The IDP teams have found that Malaria, Typhoid, dysentery, and malnutrition 
          are widespread. Land mine and shrapnel victims were also found in many 
          areas. The teams treat all the patients they can, but demands soon outstrip 
          medical supplies. The teams also find it difficult to follow-up on patients 
          as they often had to move due to SPDC patrols. </p>
        <p> On another mission, one team reported that even in villages they passed 
          through, where the people still remained, life there was almost intolerable. 
          For example, in village X a notice had just been sent to the village 
          headman from the local SPDC Army outpost. It demanded 3 men for forced 
          labor each day, 2 large baskets of rice and one message even added that, 
          "we heard Mr. Y shot a barking deer, why didn’t he give some of it to 
          us?" These types of demands may not make the headlines like the SPDC’s 
          murder, rape, and torture of civilians, but it is this type of oppression 
          that is most pervasive. </p>
        <p> What makes the mistreatment of the citizens of Burma even more demoralizing 
          is the International community’s lack of will to take strong measures 
          to stop the oppression. It is the hope of the people of Burma that they 
          can solve their own problems, yet they ask for help as so far, their 
          attempts at a peaceful and just solution have been rejected by the SPDC. 
          The IDPs are the most recent evidence of this and they need our help, 
          not only in the provision of relief, but in assisting them to change 
          the situation in Burma. One way the international community can help 
          is to apply enough pressure to the dictatorship until they’re willing 
          to change, and in the meantime provide direct relief and security to 
          IDPs inside Burma. </p>
