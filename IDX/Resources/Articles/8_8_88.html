			  <h2>8.8.88</h2>
               <p>From the People.... </p>
              <p> August 8, 1988 (8-8-88) is a special date for the Burmese student 
                movement. For several months anti-government demonstrations calling 
                for an end to 26 years of one-party rule had been growing throughout 
                the country. On August 8, these demonstrations began to reach 
                a peak as a general strike was called all over the country and 
                tens of thousands of Burmese people, young, old, men and women, 
                swarmed into the streets calling for President Sein Lwin to step 
                down and restore democracy through free elections. In Rangoon, 
                the people marched 25 abreast through the wide tree-lined streets. 
                Their procession stretched for 3 kilometers and was made up of 
                students, government workers, medical staff, and laborers. The 
                mood was that of a celebration even though in some parts of the 
                country demonstrators were being killed. Perhaps as many as 360 
                people died on this one day. </p>
              <p> Day after day the demonstrations continued, and the number of 
                people participating grew. Even some military officers joined 
                in to show solidarity with the people. It seemed to the students 
                that victory was certain. Then on September 18, Gen. Saw Maung 
                staged a military coup, and began a brutal repression against 
                the democratic movement. All over the country there were reports 
                of demonstrators being shot or bayoneted. Thousands of people 
                were arrested and put in prison. Many of them were never seen 
                again. Some people estimate that at least 8,000 people were killed 
                during these demonstrations. The majority of them were unarmed 
                students and children. </p>
              <p> For the students, hope for an end to the one-party system of 
                Ne Win through peaceful means ended. Thousands of them began the 
                long trek to the Thai-Burma border area where they could seek 
                refuge with some of the insurgent groups there. Although the international 
                press covered these events in great detail for several months, 
                their interest soon faded as other international stories became 
                more sensational. Now, the world is slowly forgetting Burma, the 
                struggle of the Burmese people and their plea for the right to 
                participate in their own government </p>
