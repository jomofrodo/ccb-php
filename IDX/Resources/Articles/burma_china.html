          <h2>Burma's Dictators, Narcotics, and China </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="greytext">24 October, 2000</div>
        <p> Burma is a failed state under the rule of one of the world's most 
          repressive regimes. The dictators, known as the State Peace and Development 
          Council (SPDC), continue to oppress their people, cause over 3 million 
          to be displaced (refugees and internally displaced), ruin their economy, 
          perpetuate 51 years of civil war, and have helped to make Burma the 
          world's second largest producer of opium and heroin. Burma is also the 
          region's leader in methamphetamine production and trafficking. In addition 
          to this, the need for Chinese assistance, (military, political and economic) 
          for their campaign to subjugate all the people of Burma, has resulted 
          in a large influx of Chinese and the People's Liberation Army's establishment 
          of four Signal Intelligence facilities and one naval base in Burma. 
          Both narcotics production and the influence of the Peoples Republic 
          of China (PRC), are threats to all the people of Burma as well as the 
          other nations of SE Asia. Burma is not only a regional human rights 
          and democracy problem, it also presents a regional and global security 
          threat by its production of narcotics and its allowance of the expansion 
          of the People's Republic of China's influence, power, and military assistance 
          into Burma. </p>
        <p> Narcotic production and trafficking in Burma provides the SPDC with 
          a major source of revenue. In 1999 alone, 1,750 tons of opium was grown 
          and processed into heroin. Over 50 new methamphetamine laboratories 
          are now located along Burma's eastern border with Thailand, and over 
          500 million methamphetamine tablets were trafficked into Thailand this 
          year. The profits from this trade in narcotics helps to support the 
          SPDC's 400,000-man army in its mission to crush all dissent in Burma. 
        </p>
        <p> The SPDC has encouraged some of Burma's ethnic groups to produce narcotics 
          in return for limited autonomy and a halt to attacks by the Burma Army. 
          Ethnic groups such as some Wa and Shan have agreed to these terms and 
          see narcotics production as the only way to keep from being forced into 
          war with the SPDC's army. The Wa in particular has made appeals to the 
          USA and the UN for a crop substitution program, economic development 
          ,and protection from attacks by the SPDC. So far there has been no action 
          on this proposal. While greed has played a part in ethnic involvement 
          in narcotics, protection or security is the greater motivation. Those 
          groups that produce narcotics and share their revenue with the SPDC 
          can have relative peace and autonomy. Those who don't are brutally attacked. 
        </p>
        <p> Ethnic groups which have no involvement with narcotics, such as the 
          Karen, Karenni, Chin, Arakan, and some Shan, are attacked relentlessly 
          by the SPDC's army and struggle to survive. For the few groups that 
          are involved, profits from the narcotics trade are used to buy food 
          and other necessities as well as to buy arms. These arms give the Wa 
          and others the leverage needed to negotiate with the SPDC. Narcotics 
          profits are shared with the SPDC in return for cash, basic goods and 
          limited political rights. Greed is also a factor, but while some ethnic 
          leaders are motivated by selfish ambition, most see narcotics as the 
          only way for their people to survive. </p>
        <p> Narcotics are not only a means for the SPDC to gain revenue, they 
          also provide opportunities to corrupt and divide the ethnic minorities 
          of Burma. While the ethnic groups are certainly not innocent, they feel 
          they have no real choice but to participate in the narcotics industry. 
          With no one to turn to for protection and sustenance, some groups have 
          chosen narcotics as the only means to feed and provide security for 
          their people. In 1999 the SPDC encouraged the Wa (United State Wa Army) 
          to relocate 150,000 of its people from the northern Wa State down to 
          Southern Shan State near the Thai border. This was a forced relocation 
          that the PRC also participated in, sending down Wa families from Southern 
          Yunnan, China. </p>
        <p> This relocation has not only paralleled the explosion of narcotic 
          trafficking into neighboring countries such as Thailand, it has also 
          resulted in a great increase of resentment and hatred by Shans and others 
          whose lands have now been invaded by the Wa and other SPDC supported 
          groups. All of this is part of the SPDC's strategy of "divide and rule". 
          Dissension between the ethnic groups is crucial to the dictator's hold 
          on power. This movement of the Wa into Shan territory is only the latest 
          example. On their part, the Wa and others say they have no real choice 
          but to move, and the hasty and ill-planned relocation has resulted in 
          epidemics, sanitation problems, and insufficient food for the new arrivals. 
          Over 7,500 displaced Wa in the Muang Yone area of Southern Shan State 
          have died this year (see attached Wa reports). </p>
        <p> While the SPDC has stepped up its involvement in the narcotics trade 
          in Burma, China too has increased its influence in that country. Four 
          Signal Intelligence sites have been established by China's Peoples Liberation 
          Army (PLA) on Burmese soil along with one naval station on Coco Island, 
          south of Rangoon. Joint military exercises have increased and in 2000 
          the Defense Minister and Foreign Minister of the PRC made visits to 
          Burma pledging solidarity, cooperation, and friendship. China also continues 
          to encourage its people to establish business in Burma and to immigrate, 
          resulting, for example, with the Chinese becoming the largest ethnic 
          group in the city of Mandalay. China has political, economic and political 
          advisors stationed in some ethnic areas such as the Wa and Kokang. In 
          these areas Chinese is the language taught in schools as well as being 
          the medium of communication used in radio traffic. This year China also 
          sent ethnic Wa from Yunnan, China down to the southern Shan state of 
          Burma as part of the forced relocation of 150,000 Wa from the northern 
          Shan state (Wa State), to the southern Shan state. China is one of Burma's 
          leading trade partners, with teak, gems, minerals, and narcotics being 
          sent to China, while arms, ammunition and other supplies are brought 
          in from China. Since 1990, China has provided the dictators of Burma 
          with over 2 billion dollars of arms and ammunition and considers Burma 
          one of its few allies. </p>
        <p> China has clearly shown its intent to influence Burma, use it for 
          its own economic purposes, and to increase its military power in the 
          region. Direct access to the Indian Ocean, signal and intelligence facilities 
          in Burma, and the ability to rapidly project power in SE Asia, seems 
          to be some of the objectives of China's involvement in Burma. China 
          does not support democracy in Burma and has demonstrated its willingness 
          to help the dictators hold on to power. The suffering of the people 
          of Burma under the SPDC's illegal and brutal rule not only results in 
          gross human rights violations, religious persecution, ethnic repression, 
          and a denial of democracy for people of Burma, it also poses a great 
          threat to the region and the world. This threat is manifested in the 
          SPDC backed explosion of narcotics from Burma to the world and the increasing 
          power and influence China asserts with Burma. The restoration of democracy 
          and the guarantee of ethnic rights are the best ways not only to bring 
          peace and justice to Burma; they are also the best means to address 
          the problems of narcotics and regional security. The international community 
          can take the actions necessary to bring this about. It is to all of 
          our best interests, and it is our moral imperative. </p>
