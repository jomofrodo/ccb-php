<b>  I got a wonderful opportunity to visit Myanmar last January.  I was with the MV Doulos for a one-week visit.  I was part of one of their travelling teams that went around the country.  My heart really bleeds for the people of Myanmar. 

  A pastor invited me to help train staff at children's homes in Chiangmai at the end of this month. Do pray that I raise enough funds for it.

  Myanmar is one countries that is really close to my heart.  It is always in my prayers.  I would like to help as much as I can.</b><br>

<b>Hi!I am Ng Zhi Min, a First-year medical student in the National University of Singapore (NUS).My colleagues and I are currently doing a Healthcare project named ' Project Somanassa", which is also part of an overseas project by the Medical Humanities Research Group of NUS. 



  We aim at setting up a medical centre in Bilin, Myanmar in which basic healthcare will be provided for the township population of 100,000 . Knowing that the CCB has always been active in improving lives of people in Myanmar,we sincerely hope that you will be able to provide us with some statistics or present situation of the health system in Myanmar and if possible, tell us what specific help do the people in small towns like Bilin need.



  Thank you for your time. Awaiting your reply. 



With warmest regards,
