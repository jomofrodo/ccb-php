<p>Hi, </p>
<p>My name is Graham West and I am running the 2008 London Marathon on 13th April 
  in aid of the Free Burma Rangers. 
<p>My Marathon Runner Number is 33287. 
<p>My wife Judy and I have been supporters of FBR for many years now and have 
  met and worked with an FBR team out on the Thai / Burma border in Mae Sot. 
<p>We are constantly fund raising for FBR and this includes me running the London 
  Marathon this year.
