  <h1>GLC Program History</h1>
This program began in 1999 when Karen Eubank was on a relief mission with FBR 
  teams to villages frequent- ly attacked by the Burma Army. The children here 
  were very shy and fearful and she envisioned a program that would give spiritual 
  encouragement of faith, hope, and love through songs, games, crafts and stories; 
  as modern medical care is infrequently available, the program also grew to include 
  preventative health- care education. The GLC program is included in FBR Leadership 
  and Relief Team trainings followed by a 1-2 month ‘School Tour’ to visit 
  school children in rural IDP communities; the newly-trained counselors help 
  lead this tour and thus have a chance to practice what they have learned with 
  their instructors present. They are the one person on their respective FBR teams 
  whose duty is to minister to the needs of the children the team meets as it 
  goes on missions throughout the year. </div>
