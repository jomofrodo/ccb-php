    school tour brings a program to 10-20 IDP sites during a 1-2 month period. 
    Students from surrounding villages will travel, sometimes from as far away 
    as a dayâ€™s walk, to come to the program. The program includes singing, spiritual 
    and moral encouragement, drama, crafts, games and healthcare relevant to the 
    local health issues (e.g. malaria, malnutrition, and sanitation). During the 
    program, the medics conduct a clinic for the village while other team members 
    construct a latrine or do other village development projects. Interviews are 
    conducted to assess the educational, security and other material needs of 
    the village. Money and school supplies are given to the teacher; and each 
    child, as well as many of the mothers, receives a gift, such as a shirt or 
    a warm hat or a pack that includes vitamins, a toy, and an article of clothing</div>
