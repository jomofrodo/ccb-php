<h1>GLC Counselors</h1>
Each four-to-fve-person FBR relief team has one member who is the designated Good 
  Life Club counselor and whose duty is to focus on children at each site the 
  team visits. The Good Life Club counselors are given training and supplies for 
  a program addressing spiritual and physical health as well as providing relief 
  sup- plies such as clothes or personal necessities when available. The Good 
  Life Club counselor is one person the children can look to whose main job is 
  to address their special needs both emotionally and physically.
