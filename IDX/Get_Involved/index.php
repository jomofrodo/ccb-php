              <h2> Supporting the Body of Christ in Burma </h2>
              <p> The Church began in Burma in the 1500&rsquo;s, with further 
                growth in the 1800&rsquo;s, and is still growing. Some estimates 
                place the percentage of Christians at over 7%, most concentrated 
                among the ethnic minorities, many of whom have been struggling 
                for some form of autonomy and freedom for decades. As part of 
                their divide-and-conquer strategy, the dictatorship uses religious 
                differences to stir up internal divisions and hatred. Persecution 
                is widespread, and includes majority Burmans and ethnic minorities. 
                Even under the weight of oppression, the Church has continued 
                to witness for Christ and grow.
