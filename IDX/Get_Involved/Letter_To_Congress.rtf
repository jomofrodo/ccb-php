I am writing this letter to request your assistance in support of relief efforts to the Internally Displaced People of Burma (IDPs).  We need your help to encourage our government to take steps to he
lp the IDPs and we need members of Congress to encourage the Government of Thailand to allow continued humanitarian relief efforts to the IDPs.
\par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs22 
\par The situation in Burma is catastrophic: Aung San Suu Kyi has been arrested again and the massacres and attacks 
on the ethnic people of Burma continue unabated.  IDPs flee from destroyed villages as the Burma Army attacks every district of Karen, Karenni and Shan States. There are over 1 million IDPs in hiding and without assistance some will die; all will suffer e
ven more and will be left with little hope.  
\par 
\par Thirteen years after the people of Burma voted overwhelmingly in favor of a democratic government, the dictators of Burma still refuse to transfer power and instead use violence and terror to maintain and expan
d their power.  This is terrorism at the state level.  
\par 
\par The situation is critical now for all those who are working to help the displaced people and it is critical for the IDPs themselves. While many Thais sympathize with the IDPs and have helped in the p
ast, there is growing pressure against assistance to IDPs, and pressure to cease the flow of refugees and to stop anyone from crossing the border for any reason, even the rendering of emergency assistance to IDPs. 
\par 
\par Humanitarian relief work has b
een done quietly but always with the knowledge of Thai authorities.  Relief efforts include medical care, dental care, emergency food supplies, educational, inspirational (Bibles and Hymnals for Christian areas), school supplies, and \'93Good Life Club
\'94 packs of toys, vitamins and cards from children around the world. These efforts also include the training and sending of ethnic relief teams of medics, pastors and teachers.

 assistance to the IDPs.  Consequently, those who provide aid to IDPs have been warned that adverse actions may be taken against them. 
\par }\pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\kerning28\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs22 
\par It would be helpful if members of Congress would write the Government of Thailand and express their gratitude and appre
ciation for all that Thailand has done for the people fleeing the oppression of the SPDC and to respectfully encourage them to allow continued relief efforts to the IDPs.  We are not asking that the Thai Government actively support relief work, but it can
not be done if they actively try to stop it.
\par 
\par We are grateful to Thailand for the help it has rendered to people in desperate need and the open door it has provided to help the oppressed.  We are also grateful to you all for your help and your stand with the oppressed of Burma.  May God bless you.

\par Sincerely,
