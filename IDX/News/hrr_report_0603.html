<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>This area of
Paan District is under severe oppression by the Burma Army (BA) and their
proxies, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, (DKBA). Every village and IDP site
visited, reported regular forced labor, beatings and shooting incidents by the
Burma army and DKBA. One village had been recently burned down by the DKBA. In
a village further south, one civilian male was shot by the DKBA as he was
walking home. In yet another attack, this time by the Burma Army, two children
were shot by troops as they were tending their cattle. Both children and the
man survived and were treated by the joint FBR team (Karen, Karenni, Shan and
Kachin medics, human rights workers, pastors, and teachers). The relief team
treated patients, interviewed villagers and IDPs, distributed &quot;Good Life
Club Packs&quot;, educational supplies, toys, sporting equipment, bibles and
hymnals, medicine, and limited cash assistance.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>There are five major road construction
projects in this area and for each of these, the Burma Army forces all
surrounding villages to provide labor. While the relief team was in this area,
the Burma army mortared a village that had not supplied enough labor for a
construction project. The DKBA also shelled villagers as they worked their fields
because they had not provided enough labor to help the DKBA build a new
outpost.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>The situation
is bad and deteriorating. Without intervention on behalf of the IDPs and
villagers in this area, many more people will attempt to flee to refugee camps
in Thailand. Ethnic people in Burma face the problems outlined in this report
daily and often the situation is worse, especially in the northern Karen State
and Karenni and Shan States. While the dictators crush the democracy movement
in central Burma and continue to hold Aung San Suu Kyi, they also continue to
brutally oppress the ethnic peoples and war against them with out mercy.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

and dental treatment</u>: Over 1,200 Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and
villagers received medical and dental treatment during this mission. The main
problems treated were ARI, Malaria, Diarrhea and Dysentery. Medicine was left
with the District leader, in a few villages that the team could not stay in for
very long, and with teachers for their students.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>3.<u> Area
described</u>: North-Central Paan District, Karen State, Burma. The area
described is approximately 40-50 square kilometers bounded by the towns of
Hlaingbwe and Paingkyon in the south to Shanywathit and Mae Tha Waw in the
North and east to Kler Day and Wa Kyaw along the Moei river bordering Thailand.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>4.<u> New
developments-Roads</u>: The Burma Army continues to use forced labor on its’
road building operations in this area. There are five major road projects. Four
are improvements of existing roads that together, completely encircle this area
and the fifth is a new north-south road that once completed, will divide this
area in two.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>1. The first is
the improvement of the road running from Shanywathit, north and then northwest
to Mae Tha Waw on the Thai border. Villagers along the road line are forced to
work on this road as well as to porter for the Burma army and DKBA soldiers who
patrol it. This road is usable all year except for the rainy season.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>2. The second
road project is the improvement of the road running east from Shanywathit to
Kler Day, and then south paralleling the Thai border on the west side of the
Moei River. Villagers are forced to work on the road and to porter for the
Burma army and DKBA. This is a three season road but not as good as the
Shanywathit- Mae Tha Waw road.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>3. The third
project is the improvement of the road running parallel to the Thai border on
the west side of the Moei River from Kler Day south to Wa Kyaw. This road then
continues southwest crossing the Dawna Range south of the headwaters of the
Paingkyon River, then continues southwest to the town of Paingkyon. There is
also a spur road that runs east from Wa Kyaw to the Moei River opposite Mae
Than, Thailand.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>4. The fourth
road project is the improvement of the north-south road that runs from
Hlaingbwe to Shanywathit. Here there is also forced labor and portering.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>5. The fifth is
a new road that is being constructed from Melaung (10km southeast of
Hlaingbwe), northeast to Htee Per, and then north to Shanywathit. This road is
being constructed using the forced labor of area villagers as well as the use
of two bulldozers.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>5.<u> The Burma
Army and DKBA</u>: In this area the Burma Army continues to strengthen its ‘
positions and has also significantly increased its’ support of the DKBA. The
Burma Army has three Tactical Operation Commands in this area with over 10
subordinate infantry battalions. Fire support consists of 60, 81and 120mm
mortars. The Burma Army numbers over three thousand in this immediate area and
while it is the more powerful force; it is increasingly delegates
responsibility to the DKBA. There has been an increase of DKBA attacks on
villages as well as increased DKBA operations that are not directly supported
logistically or with Burma Army troops. The Burma Army still controls all major
security, defensive and offensive operations as well as infrastructure operations
and security for those operations. It also overseas all DKBA actions and gives
them operational orders down to the platoon and section level when it deems the
situation requires that. It also reinforces the DKBA on major operations
against the KNU. At the same time it gives the DKBA wide latitude to conduct
its own operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The DKBA has two
brigades operating in this area (555 and999) and one battalion of 333 Brigade
vicinity Mannerplaw. The total DKBA strength in this area is over 2,000.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>While the DKBA
are co-located with the Burma Army at some camps, they have also built numerous
camps of their own that are garrisoned by the DKBA alone. Over 100 DKBA troops
of the 555 Brigade are now constructing a new camp using forced labor near Kho<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>Thaw Khi south
of Shanywathit.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>In general the
DKBA is less disciplined than the Burma Army and far worse equipped. Their
morale is low and they complain of domination by the Burma Army yet so far
there has been no meaningful resistance to Burma army orders.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

<address><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-language:JA'>Both the Burma
Army and DKBA continue to violate the human rights of the people in this area
by the use of forced labor, beatings, torture, shootings, murder, the burning
of villages and the forced relocation of villagers.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

Narcotics:</u> The Burma Army and the DKBA operate at least one methamphetamine
production site south of Paan town south of this area, but there are no known
production sites in the area described in this report. However, there are in
this area, methamphetamine storage and transload sites that are jointly
operated by the Burma Army and DKBA. Most of these sites are located along the
west bank of the Moei River across from the Thai border.<o:p></o:p></span></address>

supporting the Karen resistance movement and said, &quot;This is not a village,
this is a ringworm village.&quot; (‘Ringworm’ is the term used to refer to the
Karen people by the Burma Army). The Burma Army (BA) ordered their village to
relocate to a place closer to the Kler Day car road and Burma Army camp at Kler
Day. Mae Kre was north of the road, but the place they were ordered to relocate
to is south of the car road. This would put them in an area completely enclosed
by roads controlled by the BA and DKBA. None of the villagers moved after they
were ordered to relocate, so the BA and DKBA came, the villagers had to flee
Mae Kre, lost the majority of their belongings, and the BA and DKBA burned
their village.<o:p></o:p></span></address>
