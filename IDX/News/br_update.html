          BURMA ARMY ATTACKS ON VILLAGES AND IDPS IN NORTHERN KAREN STATE.

      </h3>

      <p>

          Date of Attacks: 3 March to 17 March, 2002 and continuing as of this

         report.

      </p>

      <p>

          Date

          of Report: 21 March, 2002

      </p>

      <p>

          Report submitted by: A relief team (FBR), assisting IDPs in Papun and

         Nyaunglebin districts of the Northern Karen State, February- March

         2002.

      </p>

      <p>

          GENERAL:

      </p>

      <p>

          On 3 March, 2002, the Burma Army launched an offensive against

         villagers and IDPs in two Northern districts of the Karen State, Papun

         and Nyaunglebin districts. These attacks follow the November

         2001-January 2002 offensive in the same area. From Nov, 2001 to March,

         2002, a total of 30 villages burned.

      </p>

      <p>

          In March alone, the Burma Army has burned down 11 villages, planted

         landmines throughout the area, destroyed numerous paddy fields and

         rice barns, looted property as well as killing two villagers who could

         not escape. The offensive is now the most intense in the

         Papun-Nyaunglebin border area with 6 Burma Army battalions conducting

         search and destroy missions.

      </p>

      <p>

          Many of these villages had just been rebuilt following their

         destruction by the Burma Army in November , December 2001 and January

         2002. In and around each village were also many IDPs (more than 2,000

         total), who had fled their villages deeper inside Burma due to earlier

         attacks. Some families have been on the run for six years straight.

         All these people are now hiding in the jungle and are vulnerable to

         discovery and attack at any time. The security of over 4,000 people in

         north-central Papun district alone is now in jeopardy as the Burma

         Army is attacking this areas from three directions, (from the north,

         south and west). This offensive has stopped the planting of new rice

         and as it follows the winter 2001 offensive that stopped and destroyed

         most harvesting, food is in critical need.

      </p>

      <p>

          The Burma Army units involved this offensive are six light infantry

         battalions (LIB), from Divisions 10, 22,33 and 44. One regular

         infantry battalion (IB), is also operating in this area.

      </p>

      <p>

          This offensive follows the November 2001- January 2002 attacks that

         destroyed 18 villages and left over 3,000 people homeless . These

         3,000 new IDPs were in addition to the 1,800 IDPs whose hiding places

         were attacked by the Burma Army at the same time.
