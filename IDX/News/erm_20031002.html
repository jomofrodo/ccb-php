  villagers in the fighting area of Mae Plae To, Paan District, Karen State, Burma 
  in September/October 2003.&nbsp; Distribution of aid, presents and medicine

  </FONT><FONT size=+1><B>SITUATION SUMMARY:</B></FONT><BR>
  <FONT size=+1>Currently the SPDC and the DKBA are carrying out a military operation 
  code-named "Power Over the Land" in order to occupy and control this area and 
  to destroy&nbsp;the No 7 Brigade Headquarters.&nbsp; The operation began in 
  the last week of July and continues to the present day.&nbsp; Due to this offensive 
  over 500 people were displaced and&nbsp;more than 40 families fled to Thailand 
  in September.&nbsp; When fleeing they had to abandon their homes, farms, cattle 
  and belongings.&nbsp; Although most of the IDPs were able to flee, one 19 year-old 
  pregnant woman was shot and killed by the SPDC and one man stepped on a landmine.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
  <FONT size=+1>The Mae Ple Doe area has been split into three sections.&nbsp; 
  This has resulted in problems for&nbsp; the following villages: Toe Thu Khi 
  village, Day Law Phya Village, Mae Ple Wah Khi village, Thay Wah Bu Village, 
  Wah Klu Bu village, Bu Way village, Htee Wah Kaley Village and Pan Klu village. 
  Some have been able to escape to Thailand, some are living in the jungle, and 
  others are being&nbsp;used by the SPDC and the DKBA to carry out forced labor 
  and to porter for the troops.&nbsp; Transportation routes to the east have been 
  blocked by landmines, which were laid by the SPDC and the DKBA.&nbsp; The SPDC 
  and the DKBA are fighting to gain control of the mountainous region to the west 
  of Moei river.&nbsp; The are conducting a three pronged attack, with troops 
  advancing from the north, south and west.&nbsp; There are nine SPDC and three 
  DKBA Battalions involved in this operation. IB 339, LIB 705, and 1 Battalion 
  from DKBA 999 attacking from the north vicinity Htee Nu Hta (across from Mae 
  La refugee camp). LIB 702, LIB 706, and 1 Battalion of DKBA 999 attacking from 
  the south vicinity Mae Plae Do. IB 97, LIB 709, and the special battalion of 
  DKBA 999 attacking from the west vicinity Lay Gau (across from Mae Ramat). Three 
  more battalions , LIB 703, LIB 708, and LIB 709 were sent in to reinforce this 
  offensive on 4 October 2003. They are using heavy artillery including 120mm, 
  81mm and 60mm 75 launchers, machine guns and landmines.&nbsp; Homes, farms and 
  animals owned by civilians in the area are being destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
  <FONT size=+1><B>MEDICAL TREATMENT</B></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=+1><BR>
  </FONT><FONT size=+1>During the mission, medical treatment was given to over 
  200 villagers living in make-shift&nbsp;tents and in the jungle.&nbsp; The main 
  problems encountered were malaria, ERI, skin infections, dysentery and general 
  stress due to the situation and the living conditions.&nbsp; Medical help was 
  provided to a mother who gave birth to her child 14 days before whilst living 
  in the jungle.&nbsp; Both mother and baby are ok at present.&nbsp; Many elderly 
  people were seen by the medic and they were given vitamins and other medicine.&nbsp; 
  All excess medicinal supplies were given to the backpack medics in the area, 
  as they had used all their supplies.&nbsp; This will enable them to continue 
  to provide medical treatment to the people in the area.</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=+1><BR>
