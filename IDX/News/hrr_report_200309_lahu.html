<DIV>The Rape: On 16 Aug 2003, Capt Aung Chan Win and his troops (Burma Army 
LIB519) came and stayed at Nam Yon village, Mong Tong Township, Shan State. At 
that time, U xx xx and his wife xx xx were planting rice in their hillside 
field. Capt Aung Chan Win and his troops went to them and fired a gun. U xx xx 
was afraid and ran away but his wife could not run because the soldiers caught 
her hand. Then, Capt Aung Chan Win asked her about her husband and accused her 
husband of being a soldier of the SSA (Shan State Army). He slapped her face and 
said "Your husband is a Shan State Army (SSA) soldier, tell us about that". xx 
xx said to them, "No, my husband is just farmer". Then, he slapped her face and 
raped her. After he raped her, 20 soldiers raped to her one by one. Then, they 
went back to the village. xx xx was unconscious when other villagers came to 
care for her. Cpt. Aung Chan Win ordered to the village headman, "Nobody must 
tell about this to other people, if other people know about this I will punish 
you and your villagers". Thus, the villagers were afraid to report the 
rape.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;<B>Note;</B> FBR - Lahu Relief mission group interviewed a villager 
Mr. xxx xxx from Nam Yon village about this rape case. He was interviewed at a

married. He is Lahu and Christian. He is a farmer.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(2) SPDC &amp; UWSA Partnership in Narcotics 
Production.</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>On 19 August 2003, Lt. Col. Kyaw Than, Battalion Commander of IB- 65 and 
Wei Hsuek Yin (younger brother of Wei Hsuek Kang) began to manufacture heroin 
and methamphetamine pills in a cave near the Mong Han River, Eastern Shan State. 
The cave is located four (4) kilometers from Mong Ham village, Mong Tong 
Township, Shan State.</DIV>
<DIV><U><B><BR></B></U></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(3) SPDC &amp; UWSA Meeting about Narcotics Production.</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>On 20 August 03, the battalion commanders of Burma Army LIB - 519, IB - 
225, IB - 277, IB-65 and Col. Kyar Law Bon, Command Commander Wei Hsuek Yin, 
Bridge Commander of UWSA Tak Mar and Tak Pin held a meeting about narcotics 
production and other local programs. They discussed how to produce more heroin 
and methamphetamines, how to get more taxes from merchants, and how to sell and 
increase the trafficking of narcotics in their areas. They also discussed how to 
get funds for the SPDC's and UWSA's "Yar Gyi Aung" meeting hall at Mong 
Tong.</DIV>
<DIV><U><B><BR></B></U></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(4) The Activities of UWSA and Kokang Chinese</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>(a) The UWSA and elements of Kokang Chinese are conducting joint narcotics 
production and trafficking into Thailand and Laos. On 16 August 2003, Kokang 
Chinese merchants and 26 soldiers of UWSA (with their guns) carried 2 million 
Methamphetamines pills from Mong Ton, Na Kaw Mu village, Shan State to Naw Uk, 
Thailand and then it was sent on to Chiang Mai. Mr. Law Yin who is Kokang 
Chinese was the main operator.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>(b) These groups also keep 100 million methamphetamine pills in a cave 
close to the Thai - Burma border where they arrange trafficking and sales to 
Thailand.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>(c) From 20 August 2003 - 31 August 2003, these same groups sent four (4) 
million methamphetamine pills to the Thai -Burma border from Hon Pa Hon Yaw, Loi 
Lang, Shan State to Mae Ai, Thailand and on to Mae Sui, Chiang Rai.</DIV>
<DIV><U><B><BR></B></U></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(5) Other Narcotics Information</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>On 13 August 03, narcotics traders paid taxes to Lt.Col. Maung Pu of Burma 
Army LIB-519, based at Mong Tong (Mine Ton), Shan State. The tax rate is as 
follows;</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1.Methamphetamines - 1 tablet - 1 Thai Baht</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2.Opium - 1 viss - 500 Thai Baht (1 viss = 1.633 kg)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.Heroin - 1 kg- 2,000 Thai 
Baht</DIV>
<DIV><U><B><BR></B></U></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(6) Forced Labor</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>a) Burma Army (B.A.) IB - 65, IB - 226, IB - 227 and LIB - 519 based in the 
Mong Tong Area, took control (by force) of rice fields owned by the villagers. 
Then the Burma Army forced the villagers to work these lands for them, to plow 
the wet rice fields and to plant rice. The villagers must work 4 acres (1 acre = 
4,840 sq), for each village. For other fields belonging to the people, the B.A 
required that each acre cultivated produce 70 tin (16 pyi) of paddy rice. If 1 
acre did not produce 70 tins, the villagers must offset this from other fields. 
In the past few years, the villagers got 40 tins per acre. Now the villagers 
must produce 70 tins for each acre. This year, the villagers are worrying they 
will not meet the quota.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>(b) Burma Army (B.A) LIB519, commanded by Lt. Col. Maung Pu, ordered to the 
villagers to send 5- 10 people from each village to the B.A camps. The villagers 
are forced to build fences around each B.A camp, to cut the trees for firewood, 
to repair roads and bridges and to assist in security for B.A camps. The 
villagers were forced to work 15 days for each group by the BA. After 15 days, 
they rotated groups (villagers). If the villagers could not come, the village 
was fined 3,000 Kyat to 5,000 Kyat for each person missing. Some villagers got 
sick but the B.A did not take care of them or give medicine to them. They also 
did not give any food for the workers. The villagers had to bring their own rice 
and vegetables.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(7) Forced Portering and Escape</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Name - Kya Heh</DIV>
<DIV>Age - 40 years</DIV>
<DIV>Sex - Male</DIV>
<DIV>Religion - Christian</DIV>
<DIV>Marital Status - Married with 2 children</DIV>
<DIV>Village - ****, Mong Tong Area</DIV>
<DIV>Place of interview -*****Lahu village, Thai - Burma border.</DIV>
<DIV>Date of interview - 25 August 2003<BR></DIV>
<DIV>When I was staying in my village the Burma Army ordered 10 villagers to 
come to LIB–- 519. Then, we went to the B.A. Camps. When we reached to them, 
they ordered to us to carry the rice, oil, bullets, etcä to send to their camps 
based on the Thai- Burma border. When we reached the jungle, the soldiers beat 
my friend because he became sick and could not go fast enough for them. Then I 
helped to him and carried his bag. When we reached to ### village, I fled from 
that village to this village. While I fled in the jungle, I got a wound on my 
foot because it was very dark. I will stay in this village 2 or 3 months and 
then I will go back to my village because I left my family at there but I am 
afraid of the Burma soldiers will beat me and force me to porter again. Thank 
you to your medical treatment. I shall never forget your kindness."</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV><B>Note</B>; we do not mention his village name for his security.</DIV>
<DIV><U><B><BR></B></U></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(8) SPDC District Rule</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>SPDC rules the Eastern Shan State by separating it into 9 districts. For 
example, in Tachilek district there are the townships of Tachilek, Mong Pyant 
and Mong Yaw. Tachilek is capital city for this district. Keng Tung, Mong Khat 
and Mong Yan are in one district and Keng Tung is capital city of this district. 
Mong Hsat, Mong Tong and Mong Pin are one district and Mong Hsat is capital city 
of that district.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>The SPDC has appointed one person to manage the political, economic, and 
social affairs for each district. These persons must support all military needs. 
They must take responsibility for all procurement of porters, to bring stones 
for road construction, the plowing of wet rice fields, the planting of rice and 
the sending of the paddy to the Burma Army.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>When the Burma Army has need, they also organize motorbikes and cars for 
transport of the Burma Army. Civilians are forced to clean in parks, provide 
free labor for building projects, cut the trees for firewood, dig fish ponds, 
and to transport rice and oil.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>The Burma Army forces civilians to contribute money whenever they celebrate 
a birthday for a company commander or battalion commander, and their wives and 
their children. The military families invite the civilians especially the rich 
people (merchants), and the leaders of USDA. Civilians must pay 5,000, 10,000 to 
100,000 kyat as a birthday present for their families. If the civilians pay for 
these birthday presents then they are favored in all business transactions. They 
also gain protection.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(9) Religious Persecution and Separation of the Ethnic 
People</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>The Lahu people in this area used to be primarily animist or Christian. The 
SPDC started religious persecution in 1993. SPDC appointed the Buddhist Lahu 
people as leaders. These people are Kya Saw (Paw Meu) for Mong Hsat district, 
Kya Mu Kyo and Kya Ca Po for Tachilek and Keng Tung districts. The SPDC supports 
them with food and money. If they want to celebrate the Buddhist religious 
festivals, the SPDC provides support.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Some Lahu people are forced to become Buddhist. SPDC officers tell them, 
"if you become Buddhist, you do not need to pay the various taxes and you do not 
need to be porters". Then the some Lahu people became Buddhist and the 
authorities gave each family a Buddhist idol and forced them to worship it. The 
SPDC has ordered that the Christian, Muslim, Hindu and animist religions should 
disappear and that all the people in Burma must become Buddhist.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>The SPDC do not allow other religious festivals, or the building of new 
churches for the Christians. In some placers the SPDC has forcefully occupied 
Christian Churches and built pagodas for Buddhism on those sites. The SPDC 
appoints the important places of the departments (Immigration dep., Health dep., 
Education dep., etc.) to the Buddhist people. SPDC also creates conflict among 
the different religions.</DIV>
<DIV><U><B><BR></B></U></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(10) SPDC's Forced Military Training</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>(a) The SPDC ordered all the battalions to do military training, not only 
the men but also all the available women in each battalion area from 1 August 03 
to 1 November 03. The Battalion Commander of IB 43 (based in Mong Pin), ordered 
all the women to attend the military training. He also said that "if they cannot 
attend the military training, don't give rice, oil, etcä to those families". 
After they are 18 years old, the children of the military (including the girls) 
are forced to attend to the military training. Some are students but they 
ordered to train and then go to school at night. While they do the military 
training, some women get sick but the BA does not give medicine to them. If they 
become too sick to attend the military training, the authorities punish them. 
Thus, some women have fled to Thailand while some women flee back to their 
parents.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>(b) For example, Burma Army Battalions No. 244, 35, and 409 ordered 10 
people from each village to come to the training ( Min Kun area). The villagers 
do not want to attend this military but they are afraid of the B. A. Some 
villagers are very old and while they are doing the training some get sick but 
they must still attend to the military training.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV><U><B>(11) The SPDC &amp; Cease- Fire groups.</B></U></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>After Khin Nyunt became Prime Minister of Burma, he gave a special 
opportunity to the ceasefire groups to promote their relationship. He said that 
he wanted to meet and discuss with the ethnic leaders to promote a closer 
friendship. He also said to the ceasefire groups, "If you can convince the 
opposition/non-ceasefire ethnic groups, I will give to you more 
opportunities".</DIV>
