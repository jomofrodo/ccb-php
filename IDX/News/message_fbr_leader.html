<div><font face="Arial">A Call to&nbsp;Intercession and
Action:</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"><b>The people of Burma are in dire need of
our&nbsp;immediate&nbsp;support and intervention.</b></font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="-1">Here is a message from a relief team
leader after a mission to the internally displaced people (IDPs) of
Burma, during May- June, 2003. It is an eyewitness&nbsp;report from
the ground and a call to prayer, thought and
action.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;As we were treating IDPs in
Karen state at a recently burned village, deeper inside Burma Aung San
Suu Kyi had just been arrested and many of her supporters murdered.
Ethnic or Burman, no one is safe from the terror of the dictators of
Burma.&nbsp; We have helped to treat and pray for women who have been
raped by soldiers of the Burma Army, children who were shot, parents
who saw their children thrown into a fire and many others who have
endured evil. They screamed for help but no one came to save
them.</font><br>
</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="-1">The world knows these things are
happening. In this world actions fall into two categories, acceptable
and unacceptable. Raping little girls, murder and burning villages is
unacceptable. If these things are truly unacceptable what must we do
as individuals and nations?</font><br>
</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="-1">Now is the time that all people must
choose where they stand, with the people of Burma or with
the</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="-1">dictators.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="-1"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="-1">In the face of evil we will not
flee, we will act with love, with prayer and with our lives. God bless
you,&quot;</font></div>
