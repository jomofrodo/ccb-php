              <hr>
              <p>One of my favorite old English carols has a verse that goes like 
                this: 
              <p> <i>What can I give Him, poor as I am?<br>
                If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;<br>
                If I were a wise man, I would do my part;<br>
                But what I can, I give Him—give Him my heart. </i> 
              <p> <br>
                I feel like I gave my body, heart, and soul to be able to go to 
                visit Shan IDPs on the border. I began getting in shape for this 
                trip over 9 months ago. Not exactly easy when you're 54 years 
                old and have never done regular aerobic exercise. By June, I progressed 
                to hiking the 11 km. road up the mountain near my home every Saturday. 
                With each plodding step I prayed for the people of Burma and for 
                my poor, struggling body (sometimes in reverse order). In August 
                and September, when I left the "easy" road hikes to begin doing 
                the jungle trail up the same mountain once or twice every week, 
                I thought about my physical agony with each panting breath and 
                mentally labored to keep my focus on the goal of passing the physical 
                endurance requirements set by Partners. 
              <p> In mid-September, after a 10-hour hike, I arrived at the training 
                site. That is when I met this woman and the baby. The woman had 
                been invited by the FBR to share her story. When the baby smiled 
                at me, two small teeth gleamed in the sunshine. When the woman 
                smiled, one solitary tooth stood like a lone sentinel at the left 
                corner of her mouth. 
              <p>&nbsp; 
              <table width="500" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="phototable">
                <tr> 
                  <td><img src="/IDX/Images/2007/20071015.jpg" width="407" height="330"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr> 
                  <td>&nbsp;</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p> Teeth. One good way to do a quick assessment among the IDPs 
                of Burma is to count teeth. Many, by the time they are 30 or 40 
                years old, have less teeth than the fingers on one hand. Counting 
                teeth is like receiving a full report in 2 seconds about poverty, 
                malnutrition, lack of education and dental hygiene, and lack of 
                access to health care. 
              <p> But though this woman tried to smile with her mouth closed to 
                hide her toothlessness, her lone tooth had spoken to me. 
              <p> <i>What can I give…poor (?) as I am? </i> 
              <p> My answer: I'm giving a lot, Lord. Look at all I did to get 
                here: All those preparatory hikes. All that time exercising in 
                between. All the expenses: good hiking shoes, energy bars, clothes 
                made of fast-drying fabric. And don't forget that 10-hour hike 
                to get here! And now, I'm still giving: giving up electricity, 
                a warm shower, a soft mattress. 
              <p> 
              <p><i> What can I give…poor as I am? </i> 
              <p> <br>
                This woman's answer: <i>I'll give this baby my love and a place 
                in my home and my heart. </i> 
              <p> <br>
                Raped and impregnated by a Burmese army soldier, the baby's mother 
                died from "complications" 10 days after giving birth. But here 
                is this 45-year-old poor, toothless woman with three children 
                ages 8-13. She certainly has enough to worry about. Living on 
                a meager food supply without a steady income in an IDP camp under 
                the noses of the hate-filled Burmese army—does it make any sense 
                to take in one more mouth to feed? She is not a relative. She 
                is under no obligation. Yet those chubby baby cheeks just begging 
                to be kissed declare, "Look how much she care about me! I'm well-fed; 
                I'm clean; I'm loved." 
              <p> <br>
                So in a few months, when I again sing this Christmas carol, I'll 
                be thinking about this woman and all that she gives. But I'll 
                be thinking one more thing: that this woman, this baby, the thousands 
                of IDPs in Burma, the thousands of women and girls who have been 
                raped by a single soldier or a gang of soldiers, may someday sing 
                with me, 
              <p> <br>
                <i>What can I give HIM, poor as I am? </i> 
              <p> <br>
                And together we will sing the answer: 
              <p> <i>What I can, I give Him…Give Him my heart! </i> 
              <p> <br>
                I want all the ethnic peoples of Burma to know Jesus, to give 
                their hearts to Jesus! And I will continue to do my part to show 
                Christ's love to them and pray that they will see Him in ME! 
              <p> <br>
                May God bless Partners and FBR as they bring hope, relief, training, 
                and the Good News!
