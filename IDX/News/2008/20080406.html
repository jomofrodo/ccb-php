<table width=100%><tr><td>Dear friends, 
<P>This letter is from my father Allan Eubank, whom many of you know has been 
  a missionary in Thailand since 1960. Some of our team and friends from the US 
  (the Geisz and Tulip families), recently accompanied him on a trip along the 
  Thai-Burma border to a boarding school and clinic we help support. During this 
  trip four Talako Karen and one Sgaw Karen asked to be baptized. This was the 
  first known baptism of anyone of the Talako (a sect of the Karen) in this area. 
<P>God bless you all and thank you for your love and prayers. 
<P>Love, Dave, Karen, Sahale, Suu and Peter Eliya Eubank

      <h2>Letter from Allan Eubank April 2008 </h2>
      <P>"We have great news to share and ask for your prayers. After 51 years of waiting, 
  we are celebrating the first baptisms of the Talako, (Talakone), Karen. Fifty 
  one years ago this June, I read a report about the Talako while I was in the 
  U.S. trying to determine where I should serve on the mission field. I immediately 
  felt called to go to them even though I new little about Thailand or Burma at 
  the time. After 3 years in seminary and a year in Bangkok studying the language, 
  I made the first visit in 1962 traveling with another missionary. Paul Dodge. 
  2 days by boat up the Kwai River and 12 days by foot and elephant to the headquarters 
  of the Talako at Laytongku, Tak Province, Thailand. They accepted us as their 
  long awaited younger brothers but they wanted political and economic help and 
  not Jesus Christ. 
<P> We made 4 visits in 5 years and then the Communist took over the area and 
  controlled it for 16 years. After the communist gave up, we returned and went 
  through a series of negotiations in which they talked with us as if we were 
  the bridegroom and they were the bride discussing marriage. We even made a covenant 
  "engagement" ceremony blessed by the most High God through a shared drink of 
  water promising to be faithful. If we betrayed each other they said we would 
  all be cursed to our children's children. 
<P>After this engagement, we tried to teach and lead them to commitment to Jesus 
  Christ. They did gradually move to worshiping the most high God, Ka Sa Y'wa, 
  but they always refused to be baptized. Later some did want to be baptized but 
  the head man ordered that if they were, they would have to move from the village. 
  (See Chap 3 in the book Where God Leads Never Give Up). 
<P>Four weeks ago that head man was shot and killed as he was traveling on a trail 
  out of town. We went back to visit and there was a new interest in the gospel. 
  Even though there was some fear of persecution, the one main believing family 
  said they wanted to be baptized now. The wife said, 'We have wanted to be baptized 
  since you first came many years ago. If you do not baptize us now, then do not 
  come back.' On Wednesday, March 26, we went down to the stream behind the murdered 
  headman's house and baptized the mother and father, their son and his wife. 
  We also baptized a Sgaw Karen man who come up at the last minute, saying, "I 
  want to be baptized too". We visited the newly elected head man, and he ensured 
  us he would uphold the Thai constitution which guaranteed freedom of religion. 
  Then we visited the hermit priest leader of the sect and discussed our commitment 
  to each other. He was somewhat reserved but did affirm that they had to cooperate 
  with their younger brother 'Pudaywa.' One of the very conservative leaders of 
  the sect invited us to lunch and said, 'You must make three more visits and 
  we will be wed.' To be wed in our understanding is to accept Jesus Christ as 
  Lord and Savior. We left a mature Karen Christian with the new Christians to 
  nurture and support them. In early May we will return to follow up. We have 
  been waiting more than 50 years for these first baptism. The mystery of God's 
  timing and human obstinacies leaves us bewildered but happy and excited once 
  more about the Talako. 
<P>Thank you all for sharing with us in this adventure for the Lord."
