<p class=MsoNormal>U.S. Senators urge Bush to promote democracy in Myanmar<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Tue Oct 7, 5:26 PM ET<br>
WASHINGTON (AFP) - Thirty-five US senators urged President George W. Bush<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>(news - web sites) to use his upcoming
trip to Thailand to further the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>cause
of democracy in Myanmar, which they say has become a serious threat to<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>regional security. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
&quot;The United States and all its allies -- particularly Thailand -- must<br>
sustain a full court press on the repressive junta in Rangoon to secure<br>
the immediate and unconditional release of Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>San Suu Kyi and her colleagues,&quot; said
Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of<br>
Kentucky, referring to Myanmar by its former name Burma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The petition said that
Myanmar's refusal to confront an AIDS (news - web sites) crisis is<br>
devastating to the health systems of neighboring countries, while internal repressions
were saddling them with millions of refugees. Democratic Senator Dianne
Feinstein of California said the current situation should be unacceptable not
only to Bush but also to countries in the region, especially Thailand.
&quot;The status quo means only continued suffering for the people of
Burma,&quot; Feinstein said. &quot;Change will only come to that country with
the help of the international community, including our regional partners.&quot;
The United States and some other nations tightened sanctions on Myanmar after
Aung San Suu Kyi was detained at an undisclosed location following a bloody
clash between her supporters and pro-junta demonstrators on May 30. The Nobel
peace laureate was admitted to the hospital on September 17 for surgery and
transferred from there to house arrest on September 26. It is her third house
arrest since the late 1980s but the<br>
junta is portraying her current status as a positive and planned development.<br
