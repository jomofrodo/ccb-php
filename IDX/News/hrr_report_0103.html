                  infant vitamins), with this Kit. </P>
                  <P>5. Tape Recorders and Radios needed (try to bring in SWR 
                  for team as well) and check that HRV reporter has a small 
                  recorder. Also extra film and batteries for local HRV 
                  reporters, such as KHRG personnel in the area. </P>
                  <P>6. Give a list of Treatment areas and IDPs targeted to the 
                  township secretary or head man before the team leaves the 
                  area. </P>
                  <P>7. Distributed gifts: Need smaller gifts and more, so all 
                  the children at each site can have one gift. Need to better 
                  plan distributions and make a plan for villages the team goes 
                  through but can not stop to help. These villages need to be 
                  included in some way. </P>
                  <P>8. Soldier and porter gifts: Better than cash, each person 
                  who helps on the mission should receive a small useful gift. 
                  Example: multiple pre-packaged gift sets:  tee-shirt, 
                  flashlight, batteries, lighter, ect. </P>
                  <P>9. Sanitation Team:  team will designate a person who 
                  will take charge of building and training villagers concerning 
                  sustainable sanitation. Latrines, trash, ect. Make sure the 
                  team washes dishes properly and maintains their own health 
                  standards. If have enough medics and women, they can also 
                  spend time in health education for children through school. 
                  </P>
                  <P>10. Many requests for the fbr t-shirts, need to bring at 
                  least 200 per mission. </P>
                  <P>11. Give "Good Life" shirts to children instead of 
                  hats·more useful, especially in the cold season. (Short and 
                  long sleeve) </P>
                  <P>12. Thanks to God and all our friends who make these 
                  missions possible. This is a team effort, dependant on God's 
                  love and the prayers and direct assistance of people all over 
                  the world. You give us hope and help us to stand. </P>
                  <P></P>
                  <P>"That way lies our hope, where sits our greatest fear. Doom 
                  hangs still on a thread. Yet hope there is still, if we can 
                  but stand unconquered for a little while." Gandalf ( Lord Of 
                  the Rings) </P></FONT>
