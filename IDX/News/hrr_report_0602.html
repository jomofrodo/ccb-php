<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;***The three pictures
attached show the <strong>massacre victims at Htee Law Bleh</strong> and are
graphic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>They are examples of the
brutality happening&nbsp;in Dooplaya District, Karen State, Burma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Introduction:</span></strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Civilians massacred,
villages burned, churches destroyed, Christian pastors and a Buddhist Monk
tortured, forced relocation, and over 5,000 IDPs, 1,000 of whom are in hiding
and fleeing for their lives. This is the current situation in central Dooplaya,
Karen State, Burma. Dooplaya district is that part of Karen State, Burma,
bordering Tak and Kanchanaburi province, Thailand, to the east, and located to
the west and southwest of Myawaddy, and North and Northwest of Three Pagoda
Pass to Thanbyuzayat and Ye. Central Dooplaya is the area from the Thai border
(between Three Pagoda Pass and Bueng Klung) to Kya Inn Seik Gyi and the Zumi
river. This report was completed by a relief team , that went to the IDPs
in this area in June 2002. The situation among the IDPs in hiding, those
already forcibly relocated, and the few villages left intact is among the worse
in Burma. This is a brutal reign of terror.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Summary:</span></strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Attacks on villagers by the
Burma Army have greatly increased this year in central Dooplaya district, Karen
State, just as they have in the other 7 districts of the Karen State and just
as they have in Karenni, Shan, Arrakan, Chin and Mon States. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>In central Dooplaya
district from April to June, over 5,000 people have been displaced, 6 villages
burned, 6 schools destroyed, 5 churches burned, 15 villagers murdered including
women and children as young as 2 years old, (12 in one massacre), 3 pastors
captured, tortured for 5 days and still held captive-condition unknown, over 28
villages attacked, looted and forced to relocate and over 1,000 people now
hiding in the jungle attempting to make it through Burma Army patrols into
Thailand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Over 4,000 more would also
attempt to flee but are too far from the border and too close under Burma Army
observation to escape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The relief team treated
over 1,300 patients, including one six year old boy shot in the massacre of 12
villagers at Htee Law Bleh , who played dead and managed to escape. The team
also distributed relief supplies and helped to escort 96 villagers through
Burma Army lines to the Thai border and safety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The team witnessed
first-hand two relocation sites, the 6 burned villages, the graves of 13 of the
15 killed, the shelling of villages as the Burma Army attempted to force all
villagers in them to leave, and the chasing of escaping villagers by the Burma
Army. The feeling of fear and hopelessness was palpable. The Burma army units
conducting these operations all belong to the 88 Division and are ruthless. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>“I don’t respect any
religion, my religion is the trigger of my gun”, were the words of Burma Army
Column Commander Khin Mau Kyi, of IB 78 as he and his unit burned villages,
churches, tortured pastors and tortured and urinated on the head of a Buddhist
monk. LIB 301, LIB 416 also burned villages while IB 77, IB 75, and LIB 317
mortared, machine-gunned and forced villages to relocate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>LIB 317 also has units
actively patrolling up to 2 kilometers inside Thailand between Bueng Klung and
Lay Ton Ku, (A. Umphang, P. Tak), as of this report. (Thailand Map-mgrs
1:50,000, 47P MT, the following grids:
MT5430,5440,5339,5340,5543,5442,5443,5341,5441.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>(See also... 'Observations'
at the end of this report)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Forced Relocations:</span></strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>28 villages have been
forced to relocate to 9 different forced relocation sites vicinity Kya Inn Seik
Gyi and 5 more villages have been ordered to relocate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The following villages have
already been forcibly relocated;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Htee Nga Paw, Htee Nga Thu,
No Maw Poo, Htee Law Bler, Htee Pa Nweh- Central, Kaw Kae, Htee Tha Bler, Tha

Htee Kam Ler, Paw Nae Moo-West, Tha Ku Kae, Ka Lay Kee, No Thaw Pla, Meh Ku,
Kyone Sein, Baw Kalo Khee, No Klo Keh, Mae Kaw Kee, Lay Kari, Htee Kapa, and
Kwan Thit Ta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The following were given
orders to relocate on 10 June, followed by machinegun and mortar attacks from
12-17 June: Mae Tha Krae, Paw Nae Moo- East , Hti Per Nweh-North, Htee Kway,
and Tha Ku Kee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Note: The Burma Army in
this area are now giving orders for village headmen to come to their camps to
receive relocation orders in person, this is also true for orders for forced
labor and porters. This is done so that their written orders are not collected
as evidence of human rights violations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Murders and
Torture:</span></strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>15 civilians have been
murdered in this area from April to June, more than 16 wounded and 11 tortured
by the Burma Army.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The following 12 people
were massacred at Htee Law Bleh on 28 April, 2002 by IB 78:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(Naw Pi Lay was a mother of 5).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>9 others were shot but
escaped, including a boy, age 6 who was shot with the 12 massacred and played
dead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>1 villager, Saw Thaw They
Htoo was killed and his body hidden ( later discovered by villagers and the
team), on 27 April by LIB 416, Commanded by They Shwee, and in May (exact date
unkown), 2 villagers from Thaw Bau were shot to death by IB 78. Over 5
villagers were wounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>On 8 May a villager from
Htee Pa Nweh was shot multiple times but survived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>On 10 June one villager was
shot and wounded at Tha Mau they by soldiers of IB 78.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>From 12-17 June 5 villages
were mortared and machine gunned by IB 78 and LIB 301, unknown number of dead
or wounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Pastors Happy Htoo, See Pa
Thru, and Pareh were tortured for 5 days outside their churches, then their
churches were burned and they the village headmen and 7 other men were tortured
again and taken into captivity and their condition is now unknown. The Burma
Army officers responsible for the torturing of the pastors are; Zaw Win Tut,
Khine Mau Kyi, Myo Tun Lyn, Than Oo and Thama Shi Shi of IB 78 and LIB 301.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Than O0 also abused a
Buddhist monk, U Pa Noo Sa, age 36 at Kaw Kae, arresting him and sending him to
a prison in Kayin Seik Gyi. There, he and 4 other monks were held for four
days, including one day of torture. At this time guards urinated on the monk U
Pa Noo Sa’s head as well as depriving him of food for one day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Forced Labor:</span></strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Forced labor and the use of
porters has increased in this area with every village (relocated or not),
having to provide monthly free labor for road construction, army camp
construction, porters for ammunition and food and any other labor the Burma
Army desires. At the army camps along the Zumi river, (vicinity Paya Ngok To),
women are forced to carry ammunition and rice re-supply for the soldiers. They
must answer the summons immediately and bring their own food.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>On the road to Kya Inn Seik
Gyi villagers are forced to purchase 4 trees each and then plant them along the
road. Forced labor is being used on the following roads; Kya Inn Seik Gyi- Koh
Kwa, Kyaik Don to Winlone, Kya Inn Seik Gyi to Tagay and Bisakat and the road
running along the Hanthayaw river vicinity Kyaik Don. All these roads are dry
season roads, however with 4 wheel drive and a winch or other help, they are
driveable all year. As this area has few high mountains and many roads that
were well constructed by the KNU (Karen National Union)&nbsp;in the past, the
road system is among the best in the Karen State. It is the aim of the Burma
Army to keep these roads open and add to them by forcing villagers to work on
them all year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>While engaged at whatever
work they are forced to do, the villagers are beaten, robbed and humiliated,
their lives completely at the mercy of the Burma Army. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Looting:</span></strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>34 villages (28 then
relocated, and 6 burned), in this area have been looted by the Burma Army with
hundreds of oxen and water buffaloes lost. Chickens, pigs, rice stocks, clothes
and any thing of value in homes have been stolen by the Burma Army leaving most
people here destitute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Observations:</span></strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The situation in central
Dooplaya is grave and without intervention will only get worse. The sight of
babies crying and children in rags fleeing the attacks of the Burma Army is
horrible and wrong. Families with all their belongings on their backs have to
struggle through dense jungle as they cannot use proper trails because of Burma
army ambushes. They are hunted, shelled and driven like animals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Some have to turn back
before reaching Thailand because there are too many soldiers blocking their
way. The resistance (KNU), manages to get a few families through but they are
vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Burma Army.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Life at the relocation
sights is brutal and there is not enough food and no medical care.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>“It is too dangerous to
stay and too dangerous to leave, what should we do? “, said one man from a
relocation site. “We are human they are human, why do they kill us like
animals…the Burma soldier looks like a man but his mind is not like a man, they
are like lions……we are going crazy, they are making us crazy, what can we do,
who will help us,…I told my people we must move but what about the new born,
what about the sick?…we feel crazy we don‘t know what to do”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A teacher told the team, “I
love education and to teach but every time our schools are burned, how can I
teach, what will become of the children, we have no hope, they have no
future…we live in fear…we heard that Aung San Suu Kyi was released and we hoped
it would get better, but no, things are even worse…we are forgotten….please
pray for us, please help us…we will not give up, we are people, we still
believe God will prepare for us”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This area is one of the
most fertile in the Karen state and relatively flat and wet, with thousands of
acres of rice fields and fruit plantations. Since the relocations and attacks
at least&nbsp;one third of the fields and orchards have been abandoned and are
now covered with weeds and thorns. Teak wood schools and churches now lie
charred and villages lay in waste. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Unless they are intercepted
by the Burma Army at least 1,000 more IDPs will come into Thailand (Nopo camp
area) as refugees this rainy season. And by all indications more will come as
the forced relocations intensify. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A relief team can give some
help, they can treat some wounds, they can pray and show love, they can be
another voice, but it will take much more to bring justice and peace to the
people of Dooplaya and Burma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It is the moral duty of the
international community to take action to save these people. The government of
Burma will not, for it is their mission to destroy them. As one IDP asked, “The
SPDC tortures, kills, burns and steals, what kind of government is this?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
