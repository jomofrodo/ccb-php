UPDATE:</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">As of 21 October,2003 the
Burma Army has retreated from the KNLA 7th Brigade HQ area. The total
Burma Army/DKBA casualties were over 300. The KNLA casualties are 15.
There are now over 1,500 IDPs in this area.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Before this retreat, on the
night of October 15, 2003, SPDC forces (12 Burma Army Battalions and 3
DKBA battalions), supported by 120mm, 81mm and 60mm mortars, took
control of the Mae Ple Do valley and part of the Eastern Dawna Range
(west of Mae La, Thailand). The KNLA defenders withdrew and began to
reorganizing their forces. The&nbsp;SPDC forces did arrive on the
banks of the Moei river near the KNLA 7th Brigade HQ but then
withdrew. According to KNLA reports,the SPDC forces were suffering
from low morale and internal dissension and that a sudden change in
orders this caused them to withdraw. There are still SPDC forces in
the area but most have been withdrawn and the offensive seems to have
stopped. The SPDC forces suffered over 300 casualties (killed and
wounded),&nbsp;and the KNLA have suffered&nbsp;15 wounded. Of the 15
KNLA wounded, 10 were from their own land mines. Over 1000 prisoners
are being used by the SPDC forces in this offensive, as porters and as
human minesweepers. At least three verified deaths have occurred when
prisoners stepped on land mines as they were forced to advance in
front of the Burma Army troops. Escaped prisoners report many more
deaths from other mine incidents and beatings by the Burma
Army.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;IDPs:</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">There are still over 1,500
IDPs&nbsp;(over 400 families), in the upper Mae Ple Do valley. They
fled there after the SPDC began this offensive in August. Relief teams
were able to reach them earlier, but at this time due to the occupying
SPDC forces,it is not possible for teams to get through the SPDC
lines. Relief teams will however,&nbsp;continue to find ways to reach
the IDPs. These IDPs have remained in hiding and do not desire to go
to Thailand as they hope to able to return to their farms
and&nbsp;their rice crops which will soon be ready for harvest. They
are hoping&nbsp;that the SPDC will retreat or will be unable to
control this entire area. The KNLA do have some forces remaining in
this area and are providing limited protection for these IDPs. The
area is heavily mined and it is difficult for anyone to move at this
time.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">PORTERS: &quot;We are already
dead, so we must try to run&quot;, a porter who escaped the Burma
Army.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Three porters have been
confirmed dead from being used as land mine sweepers and many more
rumored to be dead, but there is no access to the bodies at this time.
11 porters escaped from their forced labor with the Burma Army. Most
of these are from LIB 701, and some from LIB 704. Some porters have
been used as land mine sweepers (LIB 702 are using porters to do this
when they occupied Lay Day Point, Eastern Dawna Range, west of brigade
HQ. Many are trying to escape because they feel they are essentially
already dead. They are forced to carry loads of up to 50 kilograms
(100 lbs), and are beaten when they can't walk any further. The BA
have also set up several prisons in the area. A lottery system is used
in the prisons to determine who will stay in prison and who will be
sent to special holding camps for further use by the Burma Army. The
SPDC are expanding their pool of prisoners by increasing arbitrary
arrests (such as arresting people involved in public arguments or
loitering), for the purpose of increasing the number of porters
available to the Burma Army . When the BA battalions need porters,
they take them from the prisoner holding camps. The SDPC has increased
its use of prisoners for forced labor and military operations to avoid
accusations of civilian forced labor by the international community.
Of the prisoners forced to support the SPDC attacks in Paan district
this month, most were those with sentences of 10 years or less. For
example, of the 40 prisoners from&nbsp; Ma Oo Bin prison (near
Rangoon), 37 prisoners had prison sentences from 3 months to 10 years,
and only 3 have prison sentences above 10 years.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">During this October offensive,
over 1,000 porters were used.There were 12 BA battalions involved.
Each battalion used 100 porters, almost all of these were
prisoners.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Mr.XXX, the twenty-nine
year-old Burman man (pictured above), was used as a porter by the
Burma Army, and suffered injuries when used as a human land mine
sweeper. He and other prisoners were forced to walk in front of the
soldiers. On October 6, 2003 two of the porters with him were killed
when they stepped on a land mine and he and two others were injured.
In the confusion they were able to escape and were given refuge with
the Karen National Liberation Army. Before he escaped, Mr. XXX said
that he was forced by the Burma Army to clear the ground by touching
it with his foot to see if there were land mines.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">He was almost finished with
his three year prison sentence when he was taken along with 50 others
to porter for the Burma Army. He was with troops from the Burma Army
Division 22, in a battalion under the command of Cdr. Myo Zaw. At
night the soldiers would sleep surrounding the porters so they would
not escape. The porters were fed approximately a teacup sized amount
of rice during one day and only one spoonful of curry.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Note; We thank God for all who
prayed. For now the attacks have ceased and the Burma army has
withdrawn.</font></div>
