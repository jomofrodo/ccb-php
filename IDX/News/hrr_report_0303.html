<br>
Mission Purpose:</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">The purpose of this relief
mission to the South-Eastern Shan States was to bring help, hope and
love to the IDPs and villagers of this area. A joint Karen/Karenni
Relief Team and a Shan (SSA) relief team conducted a brief (2 weeks),
mission in March 2003. The combined teams provided medical care,
distributed educational supplies, &quot;Good Life Club&quot; packs,
bibles, sporting equipment and toys, cassette tape players and
educational tapes as well as clothes and other supplies to IDPs and
villagers. The teams also encouraged the people by reminding them that
they were not forgotten and even though they lived under the
oppression of the Burma Army, God loved them and the world cared about
them.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br>
Mission Report:</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Relief mission to the South
Eastern Shan States, March 11-25, 2003.&nbsp; This area is controlled
by the Burma Army and United Wa State Army (UWSA- Wei Zau Kang).&nbsp;
The Shan resistance (Shan State Army, SSA), attempts to resist the
Burma Army and provide some safe areas for fleeing IDP's.&nbsp; Shan
IDPs continue to escape from Burma Army forced relocation sites at
major towns and roads.&nbsp; They leave in small numbers of 1-3
families and make their way to SSA areas or into Thailand.&nbsp;
During this relief mission the  team documented cases of rape,
torture and forced labor as well as Burma Army involvement in the
production and trafficking of heroin and amphetamines.&nbsp; The
relief mission went to Shan, Pa-O, Chinese, and other IDPs as well as
villagers living under the Burma Army and UWSA rule.&nbsp; IDPs and
villagers received medical treatment, good life club packs, and
cassette tape players, tapes and educational supplies.&nbsp; The
mission area was from Mai Soong (south of Mong Hsat, Burma), in the
east, to Kang Pha in the west (northeast of Ho Mong, Burma), and north
up to the Salween river.&nbsp; In this area the Burma Army and UWSA
exercise joint control over the population as well as the growing of
opium and the manufacturing of heroin.&nbsp; There is one main dirt
road that runs from Ho Mong in the west north above the Thai border
and east to Mong Kyawt and on to Mang Hsat and to the Thai border
vicinity Piang Luang.&nbsp; Joint Burma and UWSA units are stationed
along this road as well as in outposts in the surrounding mountains.&nbsp;
In most villages at 3,000 foot elevation or above, opium is grown.&nbsp;
This opium is taxed yearly by the Burma Army and transported along the
main dirt road east through Burma Army and UWSA outposts to heroin
refineries at Kang Pha, Mong Htaw, and Mong Kyawt.&nbsp; These labs
are operated by Chinese technicians (mostly from Khua Sa's defunct
MTA), and guarded by Burma Army units as well as the UWSA. There are
heroin and amphetamine laboratories in Ho Mong under joint control of
the Burma Army and SSS-South Shan State army-under the ethnic Wa
leader Maha Ja.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Across the Salween to the
north, most Shan people have been forcefully relocated to Mong Pan
and&nbsp; Mong Ken Tong (a forced relocation site north of Mong Pan),
leaving mostly Lahu, Lisu and Pa-O highland villages.&nbsp; These
villagers are ordered to produce opium by the Burma Army and are taxed
annually.&nbsp; The general situation is bleak, with over 15,000 Shan
displaced in this area (there are more than 300,000 total displaced in
the Shan States), and much of the remaining population engaged in the
production of narcotics under the control of the Burma Army, directly
or through the Burma Army controlled UWSA and SSS. The area the relief
teams worked in was entirely under the thrall of opium and heroin. Up
to a third of the male population of each village visited was smoking
opium, laying in small huts, drugged and apathetic. The women do most
the work and aside from the two IDP sites secured by the SSA, there
were no schools or clinics. The Burma Army taxes each village for its
opium and directly oversees two of the three heroin labs in the area
(Mong Htaw and Mong Kyawt). The SSA state they are not involved in the
narcotics trade and have a policy to fight narcotics production and
trafficking.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br>
<u>Interviews with Rape Victims:<br>
</u>The team interviewed three Shan IDP women who were raped by
soldiers of the Burma Army between April and August 2002. Their names
and villages have been suppressed for their protection.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">1). Nang Xxx, 33 yrs. old,
married with 2 children. In August of 2002 she was raped in her rice
field in the vicinity of Xxx village, which is near Wan Kun Lu
village.&nbsp; The soldier who raped her was one of thirty Burma Army
soldiers on patrol. The soldiers held her down and one raped her.
There were three other women raped in her village.&nbsp; Her husband
was also frequently forced to porter for the Burma Army and was
beaten. They fled to an IDP site at Xxx&nbsp; Xxx in December,
2002.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">2). Nang Xxx 37 yrs. old,
married with 2 children.&nbsp; In August of 2002 she was raped by a
soldier of the Burma Army in her home at Wan Xxx, Lai Ka township.&nbsp;
During the rape she lost consciousness.&nbsp; Five or six Burma Army
soldiers came into her house.&nbsp; One soldier held her arms and
covered her eyes with a cloth, while another held her feet and a third
soldier raped her.&nbsp; The other soldiers stole her goods and shot
two chickens with a slingshot.&nbsp; &quot;I screamed but there were
only women in the village at the time and I was helpless. I passed
out.&nbsp; We came herein December of 2002, 2 months ago. I am very
afraid. My heart is weak now because I am so
afraid.&quot;&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">3). Nang Xx Xxx, 37 yrs. old,
married with 1 child,&nbsp; from Xxx Xx village, which is near Wan Hi
Seng village. In April of 2002, she was walking to take rice to her
husband in their rice field when &quot;many&quot; Burma Army troops
appeared.&nbsp; Five or six raped her.&nbsp; She lost consciousness
and was later found by relatives and taken by oxcart to the village
clinic.&nbsp; Her husband found her there.&nbsp; &quot;We came here
because I was raped, the Burma Army oppressed us and we were afraid.&nbsp;
In the past two years there has been a great increase in rapes in our
area of the Shan States.&nbsp; We want the world to know it; to help
us go home.&nbsp; The SSA help us here but we want to go home.&nbsp;
No one is left at our village, all have
fled.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div>

team continued walking and found the group of Chinese who had
constructed a sleeping hut and kitchen. They had also started work on
what the SSA said was to be a heroin laboratory.&nbsp; There was 6'
long by 4' wide and 3' deep pit dug 20-30' feet above a small
stream. This was similar to the other old heroin laboratories we had
encountered earlier. The team was told that the pit is for the boiling
and rendering of raw opium which is then gravity fed down to bottles
below. When questioned the Chinese group said they were &quot;making
white powder&quot;. This can mean the making of lime or it is also the
expression for refining opium to heroin. They would not answer for who
they were making the powder and were visibly nervous and angry. The
SSA said these Chinese were working for the UWSA (Wei Zau Kang), under
the protection of the Burma Army. The SSA said that the SSA and UWSA
try to avoid attacking each but that the SSA will attack all known
narcotics sites. According to the SSA, this site would not be attacked
at this time as there were not yet any narcotics here, this was a
relief mission and they wanted to avoid a fight, and since the Burma
Army was closely following the team, this site should only be reported
on at this time. The SSA said they did not want to fight fellow
ethnics and any attack on UWSA operations had to be cleared with the
SSA Headquarters. The team moved on. Location of this site: N 19 53 59
E 098 15 38&nbsp; Elevation: 776m .<br>
