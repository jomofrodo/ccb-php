</B></font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2">The Kler Lwe Htoo Free 
Burma Rangers Relief team brought relief supplies, medical care and enocuragement 
to the Internally Displaced People in Ler Doh Township of Naunglyabin District, 
Karen State, during this recent&nbsp;mission.</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2">While they were traveling 
through this area, they treated over 800 patients, distributed educational materials, 
medicine, emergency cash, food, clothing, bibles, hymnals, and cassette tape players 
with educational tapes.</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2">The Burma Army toops have 
been building roads in this District and have essentially cut off any easy travel 
by the villagers to and from their own fields or to other villages. Many reports 
of villagers being hurt or killed by Burma Army land mines or being shot at by 
the Burma Army were collected by the team. Forced portering, confiscation of villagers' 
personal property and other human rights violations are a common occurence in 
the area the team visited.</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2">The team received many requests 
for support of children who would like to attend school. At present, many children 
are not able to study because of Burma army activities and the resultant food 
shortages. In the 14 villages the team visited, there were only 4 schools operating.</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2">The most recent attack on 
this area by the dictators' Burma Army troops was on July 22nd, 2003.&nbsp;Troops 
from the Burma Army (IB (60)) shot and killed a 57 year old man, took his rice 
supply and money and continued thier patrol.</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2"><B><BR>

New information about narcotics trafficking by the UWSA&nbsp;and the activities 
of a&nbsp;Lahu relief team are included in this report.&nbsp; If you have any 
questions about this report, please reply to freeburmarangers@pobox.com.<BR>
<BR>
The&nbsp; Lahu relief team conducted a mnedical and general relief mission as 
well tas the support of an&nbsp;orphanage and the&nbsp; documentation of the human 
rights situation along the Thai - Burma border.&nbsp;Since this area is also the 
scene of narcotics tafficking the relief team submitted the information below.<BR>
<BR>
On 16 August 2003, 26 soldiers of the UWSA (United Wa State Army) and Chinese- 
Kokang brought over 2 million methamphetamine pills&nbsp;and crossed the Thai-Burma 
border vicinity Nang Ko Mun, Nawng Ok.&nbsp;This shipment is owned by Law Yi, 
who is Chinese - Kokang. There are over 100 million amphetamine tablets stored&nbsp;in 
a cave along the Thai - Burma border. &gt;From this location the amphetamines 
are sent into Thailand.</font><font face="Geneva" size="2"><BR>
</font><font face="Geneva" size="2">Four million of these tablets have already 
been packaged and have been sent across the border vicinity Ho par ho yaw, Loi 
Lang, Mae Ai and Mae Sui areas (Chiang Rai Province) of Thailand. These movements 
occured between 20 August until 31 August 2003.&nbsp;</font><font size="2"><BR>

2003 Relief Mission to Dooplaya District, Karen State, Burma</B></font><font face="Geneva" size="2"><BR>
</font><font color="#000000" size="2">FROM THE DOOPLAYA FBR TEAM;</font><font color="#000000" size="2">'The 
Dooplaya FBR mission assisted the villagers and those who are in desperate need. 
The villagers ,particularly in Kya Aye Township, are facing constant military 
offensives by the SPDC's (Burma Army) troops. Due to the continuous brutal oppression 
practiced by the SPDC troops these villagers fled and made shelters in the jungle.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
</font><font color="#000000" size="2">In Dooplaya District there are 23,183 Internally 
Displaced People (IDPs). They are facing insufficient food, serious diseases, 
and also lack good security. These people are always trying to think where they 
will flee next if the Burma Army troops come again.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
</font><font color="#000000" size="2">When the team arrived to the areas in Wal 
Raw Township, found the SPDC troops had committed the following human rights violations;</font><font color="#000000" size="2">(1) 
A woman was arrested by the BA troops when entering a village. She was called 
to the BA military camp and raped.</font><font color="#000000" size="2">(2) A 
villager was tortured severely by the BA troops.</font><font color="#000000" size="2">(3) 
A villager was arrested by the BA troops when entering village, and then forced 
to be a porter for them.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
</font><font color="#000000" size="2">The FBR&nbsp;team arrived at the IDPs hiding 
places and held times of worship. After that we distributed Bibles, Hymnbooks 
and some clothes to the villagers as well as toys and gifts for the children. 
In most places we treated the patients for two days. We encouraged and prayed 
for them to be free from all forms of oppression practiced by BA troops. We prayed 
to God for blessings for them, and that one day they will be able to live in their 
own native villages.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"><B><BR>
</B></font><font color="#000000" size="2">At the time of our FBR team mission 
to Dooplaya District, at every place, the villagers are in desperate need. They 
particularly need medical attention. There were many patients not able to leave 
their beds. Some people even suffered severe diseases to the point of unconsciousness 
because they didn't have sufficient medicine, and they had no proper food or shelter.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
</font><font color="#000000" size="2">They are always facing a life on the run, 
fleeing and hiding from the severe offensives launched by the Burmese military 
troops. In order to lessen their hardships and suffering, we find that the missions 
like this should continue and increase in these areas. Moreover, those villages 
which have no schools should&nbsp; have schools established, as well as medical 
training and vocational training such as agriculture and live-stock breeding.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"><B><X-TAB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</X-TAB></B></font><font color="#000000" size="2">During the mission, the organizations 
such as KWO (Karen Women's Organization) and KYO (Karen Youth Organization) also 
joined with us. Altogether about 40 people participated in the mission. Because 
of this, we had a problem of food and security.'</font><font face="Geneva" size="2"><BR>

2003 Relief Mission to Paan District, Karen State, Burma</B></font><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2">A 
Karen&nbsp;Free Burma Rangers Relief team went to the Paan District of Karen State, 
Burma. They were able to serve and encourage the people there. In the areas they 
visited, there is increasing pressure on IDPs and villagers to have no contact 
with outsiders and follow all instructions given by the Burma Army and their proxy 
army, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA). The team provided medical care 
and distributed what supplies they could to the IDPs and villagers.</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2">A taped interview with IDPs 
done by the FBR team can be summarized as follows. June 15, 2003; IDPs interviewed 
said that SPDC(Burma Army) and DKBA came in to XXXX village and beat villagers 
with guns. They also killed pigs, chickens, and ducks. They forced the villagers 
to carry loads fro them and forced them to go to their camp at Kaw Tho Kee and 
clean it up,. They stold the villagers' possessions. Two troops from BA Battalion 
703 Column 1 under Htun Htun Win, and #2 Htun Htun Naoung went to the village 
and beat the headman. They didn't ask any questions, only beat him. They also 
kicked his pregnant wife. The SPDC and DKBA soldiers stole 4.6 million (approximately 
800,000 Thai Baht or $20,000) worth of goods from the villagers and the village 
store.</font><font face="Geneva" size="2"><BR>

</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2">This is the report of an ethnic 
Karen Paan Free Burma Ranger team on a relief mission to serve the Internally 
Displaced People (IDPs) in Paan District, Karen State, Burma from February 4 to 
April 5, 2003,. Their purpose was to uplift the IDPs and villagers and remind 
them they should have freedom and equality, and that they are not forgotten by 
the world.<BR>
<BR>
The team conducted most of its work Na Bu township and Paing Kyong Township, eastern 
Karen State, west of the Dawna mountain range, opposite Tha Song Yang Township 
of Thailand.</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
The general situation the team reported was bleak and continuing to deteriorate. 
The Burma Army, reinforced by the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), a proxy 
army of the dictators, continue to force villagers to labor for the army and at 
least once a year attack villagers in the Dawna area. Sixteen interviews were 
conducted by this team with villagers in the area. The forced labor reported in 
interviews with IDPs indicated increased forced labor in road construction, with 
no food or pay given to the IDPs working on the roads. The Burma Army and DKBA 
kill and steal livestock from most villages they visit. At least 700,000 Kyat 
(17,500 Thai Baht or US$425), a large sum in Burma, worth of villagers' possessions 
were stolen or destroyed by the Burma Army or DKBA troops. Ten farm houses were 
burned to the ground and many in this area have recently moved into hiding because 
of the constant persecution by the Burma Army and DKBA.</font><font face="Geneva" color="#000000" size="2"><BR>
On February 21, 2003, a combined SPDC and DKBA force attacked the villagers at 
Ti Baw Plaw, burning down villagers' field huts and cow fences. This attack disrupted 
the feeding of the cows and bulls during the difficult rainy season.<BR>
<BR>
At 11am, March 7, 2003, a 35-year old Karen man was attacked by DKBA troops. He 
and a friend were visiting friends in a nearby village and the DKBa soldiers asked 
for money for alcohol from the two men. They gave them 300 kyats, and started 
to leave, when the troops beat the man in the head until he started bleeding.<BR>
<BR>
Please pray for the Paan District, Karen State, and all of Burma. The IDPs need 
immediate and long-term help to ensure their security and give them any hope for 
the future. The Paan FBR team thanked those who helped give them security and 
assistance while on their trip.&nbsp;</font><font size="2"><BR>
