<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">From the beginning<b> of
September to 16, 2003</b> due to fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;between KNLA
(Karen National Liberation Army) troops and combined troops from SPDC
(State Peace and Development Council or Burma Army) and DKBA
(Democratic Karen Buddhist Army), about 152 people (children to adult)
from 37 households became war victims and fled to the Thai-Burma
border to take refuge.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">They were from villages such
as Thi Wah Pu, Wa Klu Pu, Po Thwee Mu and Htee Ka Par, located in Thi
Wah Pu Village Tract in Ta Nay Chah Township of Pa-an District.&nbsp;
As a result of the meetings between KNU (Karen National Union) leaders
and Thai local authorities on 16/ 9/ 2003 and 18/9/2003, these
villagers were settled at a Buddhist temple compound in Klen Mu Kyauk
village in Tha Song Yan Township of Tak Province. Most of these war
victims were women (mothers) and children. Relief teams are now in the
area attacked to assist the IDPs who have not fled to the Thai
border.</font></div>

mission from June until August 2003. The members of the team are from
the Paan District and they traveled in their home area to help those
who have recently been attacked by the Burma Army and Democratic Karen
Buddhist Army (DKBA) troops.</font></div>

troops&nbsp;burned down Si Pa Day Kii village, K'nen Lay Kaw Htit farm
houses, Hsi Pa Day Kee village and farm houses, Htee Th'Blu Hta
village and farm houses. The area has become a free-fire zone, with
Burma Army(BA) and DKBA troops shooting anyone they see who is not
staying in areas they have designated. The BA has restricted
the&nbsp;movement of villagers, cutting off access to the villagers'
fields and thus thier&nbsp;livelihood. The combined BA and DKBA troops
have looted villagers belongings and forced the villagers' to work as
slaves for them. The report names over 20 villagers who were tortured
or beaten by the BA and DKBA troops and Naw Mu Kut, who was raped and
killed by a DKBA soldier.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">The Mutraw FBR team conducted
a mission and visited villagers, particularly in Lu Thaw Township and
border areas of Mutraw District. It was found that the villagers
living in the areas here are facing many difficulties. The worst
situation for them are the brutal military offensives practiced by the
Burma Army. When we met with them we talked about their sufferings and
then we encouraged and prayed for their sufferings, lives, and
survival.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">The troops of KnSO (Karenni
Solidarity Organization), a group that&nbsp;surrendered to the SPDC
recently, joined with SPDC troops and launched a offensive along the
border area of Mu Traw District, Karen State&nbsp;and the
southern&nbsp;Karenni State. They have also attacked the hiding places
of IDPs, forcing some to flee to Muthraw district. The commandersz of
the KnSO are Bo Tet Net, Ker Per Wah and Kyaw Nee Doh. They combined
with SPDC troops, stationed in the&nbsp;Maw Kyi area. The IDPs in the
border area are facing difficulties such as food shortage, clothes,
and diseases. With fear and in a difficult situation, all they can do
is work to survive.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">At all of&nbsp; the IDP
locations we visited, we distributed Bibles, Hymnbooks and provided
medical treatment. We also provided them with health knowledge in
order for them to be aware of how to care for their health and prevent
diseases.</font><font face="Arial"> The team treated a total of 663
patients. The most common things patients were suffering from were
malaria, anemia, and acute respiratory infections.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">It was found that all of the
IDPs in the area are living in a constant fear and move from place to
place, desiring to be free from the Burma Army's oppressions and
movements. The main necessities for them are food, clothes, health
care, and good security. Some villagers are Christians and some are
Animists. In education status, it was found that some areas the
villagers themselves have tried their best and set up primary schools
as the situation permits in their locations.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" color="#000000">In order to do better for
further missions we wish to the leaders will correct and make
suggestions to us where it is necessary.</font></div>
