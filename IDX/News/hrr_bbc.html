	<title>THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE</title>

	  



<br>
<h2>PI FOR CORRESPONDENT: THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In 1948 Burma became an independent country, that same year its minority people the Karen declared themselves a separate nation - and since then have been fighting a guerrilla war against the government.  In the last decade the ruling regime has successfully pursued a policy of ridding itself of many of the troublesome Karen, forcing them into Thailand as refugees or leaving thousands displaced in the jungle in its attempt to create a country defined by a muddle of Buddhist and Marxist principles. After a series of massive military operations in the 90's many minority groups simply gave up, signing ceasefire agreements and accepting the rule of Rangoon. </p>



<p>The Karen continue their war but to outsiders it appears to be a losing battle - the rebels fielding a dispirited army of less than 5000 against the regimes 350,000. Their plight has been hidden from the world's eyes for several years now, since the regime's military successes against the rebels in the mid-90's there has been little investigation of the human rights abuses being carried out against them. The reasons are simple, there is no free press in Burma, and access for outsiders to the frontier areas is only possible by a long and dangerous journey across the Thai border. Attention has focused on the imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi and the crushing of the democracy movement in Rangoon. As the Karen-held territory has shrunk, it has become harder to bypass the minefields and ever increasing ranks of Burmese troops. 

</p>

<p>Now BBC Correspondent has been given unprecedented entry to the ranks of a small band of individuals who work to help the Karen people inside Burma. Highly dangerous and illegal, the humanitarian assistance carried out by these keeps the dream of Karen identity and self-governance alive. 

</p>

<p>It is a strange band - young Karens, trained and helped by American ex-special forces, running missions inside Burma assisting and encouraging the internally displaced. A disparate group of dreamers, preachers, medics and soldiers who push deep into the jungle trying to find the scattered groups of displaced hiding from the Junta's forces. 

</p>

<p>The tale of the Karen is one of a people who have been on the run for years - sick, chronically depressed and forgotten. Thousands of families are surviving in this jungle, fleeing from raids on their villages - where men are taken for labour, women raped and houses burnt to the ground. They circle the jungle, hoping to return home if the army leaves, otherwise they make their way to the border where their reluctant hosts the Thais process them into camps. 

</p>

<p>The Correspondent team joined the unit, penetrating the Burmese lines to uncover the destruction and killing carried out by Rangoon. The band are as unlikely a group as could be imagined; an American ex-special forces soldier who is now a successful dentist, a young Karen nurse whose husband was killed by the Junta and a probation officer from Pennsylvania who told his wife he was working safely on the Thai side of the border. </p>



<p>Paw Htoo is a young woman who has lost everything; Burmese soldiers killed her husband and she was imprisoned for two years, giving birth to a child she was forced to give up. She herself was nearly executed by her own people because they thought she had joined the junta whilst held in prison.  Unlike many Karen women, she is unbowed. She is the voice for the next generation of Karen, all but forgotten by the outside.</p>



<p>Her colleague Shannon Allison is a former Special Forces soldier and trained dentist. He left his comfortable practise in Louisiana and his middle class surroundings for a hammock and a battered colt-45 pistol. His friend Don Acker has volunteered to act as the team's fact-finder, documenting the abuses in each village. Each finds himself changing dramatically as the tension and danger from the Burmese increases. As the trip unfolds Shannon falls sick and Don realises he is at the mercy of the Karen and the Burmese with a five-day walk to safety if he is wounded. </p>



<p>Smuggled down the Salween River, the team marched by day and night, some times upwards of 40kilometres a day. With thousands of dollars worth of medical supplies, the medics passed from village to village giving rare and much needed treatment to the Karen. Here in the jungle it is the simple diseases that kill - malaria, dysentery, minor infections - all easily treated by modern medicine. But here there are no doctors; there is no electricity, no running water.   </p>



<p>They call themselves the 'Free Burma Rangers'; old army comrades joined together again to fight against the regime. They shun violence but as one American said - "killing ain't right but there is a time and a place for it."  It is an NGO with a difference for these Americans have taken sides. They work as medics but travel armed. For them there are no niceties in the Burmese jungle; if they see the Burmese troops they will fight. </p>



<p>As the Rangers passed through the safe areas and into the districts where the Burmese Army is active, we came upon numerous examples of human rights abuses the regime would prefer uncovered. A young Burmese - only 16 years old, tells how he was abducted from his parents' farm to be used as slave labour. He describes in detail how he witnessed three men shot down who tried to escape. Press-ganged into the Army, he was brought to Karen state and eventually escaped. Now he will spend the rest of his life in a refugee camp. 

</p>

<p>As our trip progresses, the Burmese begin their dry season offensive against the Karen. Daily, we hear of attacks on isolated hamlets. As we walked through the mountains we could hear the thud of mortar shells landing in the villages. Finally we reached areas where only several months ago troops had burnt and destroyed the houses of people already displaced last year. 

</p>

<p>It is a brutal cycle; we came across a school where the Rangers had watched local children being taught last year. One American can barely restrain himself as he remembers the faces of the people he met, far removed from the charred embers of house frames and burnt textbooks scattered across the jungle floor. The local school teacher can only reason that the Burmese want to destroy the Karen, the Americans call it a slow form of genocide. 



</p>



<p>Every year the troops do the same thing, destroying the annual rice crop or stealing the harvest rice - ensuring there will be no food in that area for another year. Each year the people rebuild in a different area and each year their houses are burnt down, finally forcing many to leave for the border. Towards the end of our trip we find hundreds of Karen hiding in the jungle as the Burmese advance closer, they have abandoned their crops, their livestock and their possessions. By the end of our trip we discover many of the villages we had passed through are now destroyed. </p>



<p>The role of the British in this tragedy is especially poignant. The Karen fought loyally alongside the British in WW2. In each village we passed through we found old men who remembered the British officers who led them. Many asked if we had returned to fight alongside them - all remember the promises of the British officers - that they would be given independence for their loyalty to the Empire. To this day, they continue to believe the British will return. </p>
