Asian Wall Street Journal<BR>Wednesday, July 17, 2002<BR><BR><BR>A 
Regime Change
in Burma<BR><BR>By BENEDICT ROGERS<BR><BR>It is now well over two months 
since
Burma's democracy leader Aung San Suu<BR>Kyi was released from house 
arrest. Yet
nothing has changed and, for the<BR>ethnic minorities who have been 
fighting a
53-year struggle for freedom,<BR>the situation has got worse. It is, 
according
to some, the worst year for<BR>Burma's ethnic groups since 1997. But 
still the
world remains almost<BR>silent about their plight.<BR><BR>A senior Karen 
leader
told me recently that when Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was<BR>released, his 
people
hoped for three things: the release of all other<BR>political prisoners, 
an end
to the Burmese military regime's war against<BR>the ethnic minorities 
and the
start of meaningful dialogue between the<BR>junta, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi 
and the
ethnic groups. The junta has so far<BR>failed on all counts.<BR><BR>The 
junta is
not just oppressive, it is obscene. Its tactics are not just<BR>violent, 
they
are vulgar. The actions of one Burmese military commander,<BR>who led 
his
soldiers in attacks against villages in Karen state, speak for<BR>the 
regime. He
was recently described by an eyewitness -- in a report by<BR>the Free 
Burma
Rangers, a humanitarian group that operates deep inside<BR>Burma -- as 
urinating
on a Buddhist monk's head and then saying: "I don't<BR>respect any 
religion. My
religion is the trigger of my gun."<BR><BR>In another well-known 
incident,
described to me by a relief worker for a<BR>group operating in the 
refugee camps
along the Thai-Burmese border, a<BR>Burmese soldier entered a Karen 
village and
saw a 15 year-old girl walking<BR>with her father. He shot her father 
dead,
raped the girl and then put the<BR>barrel of his gun inside her and 
fired. "This
was not an ordinary crime,<BR>this was a dirty crime," said the relief
worker.<BR><BR>A Burmese general a few years ago revealed the true 
intentions of
the<BR>junta when he said: "In ten years all Karen will be dead ... you 
will
have<BR>to visit a museum in Rangoon to see one." If the world does not 
act,
that<BR>intention may become a reality. Of the seven million Karen
population,<BR>there are an estimated 100,000 refugees in Thailand and a 
further
300,000<BR>have become displaced from their homes and are trapped in the 
jungles
of<BR>Burma. Their villages have been destroyed and their crops burned.
The<BR>report from the Free Burma Rangers describes the Karen as 
"hunted,
shelled<BR>and driven like animals."<BR><BR>It is not only the Karen or 
Karenni
who are suffering. There are still<BR>1,000 or more political prisoners 
held in
Burmese jails. And the Shan<BR>people -- another ethnic minority in 
Burma --
have been the targets of a<BR>renewed offensive in recent months. The 
Burmese
military has been arming<BR>Wa ethnic forces to fight the Shan, and has 
put drug
warlord Wei<BR>Hsueh-kang in charge of a new militia group tasked with
destroying the<BR>Shan State Army's bases along the Thai 
border.<BR><BR>Now the
junta wants Thailand's cooperation in its offensive against 
the<BR>ethnic
groups. Burma recently requested permission for its troops to 
enter<BR>Thai soil
to pursue ethnic leaders. Bizarrely, the Thai defense 
minister<BR>declined to
comment. A few days later he announced orders for the 
Thai<BR>authorities to
arrest any ethnic leaders found in Thailand. So not content<BR>with 
squeezing
the ethnic groups inside Burma, the junta wants to raise<BR>the pressure 
on them
from Bangkok as well.<BR><BR>The junta only released Ms. Aung San Suu 
Kyi in an
attempt to divert<BR>international pressure on it for reform. Now, in a 
further
effort to<BR>divert attention away from its human rights abuses, Burma 
has
been<BR>stirring up nationalist sentiment and provoking tensions with
Thailand.<BR>While the Karen were initially suspected of carrying on an 
attack
on a<BR>school bus in Thailand earlier this year, their leaders claim to 

have<BR>investigated the case and found evidence to prove it was instead 
the
work<BR>of Burmese military intelligence. Rangoon has been creating
border<BR>tensions "very systematically," said one Karen leader, to 
shift
the<BR>spotlight away from pressure for political change within
Burma.<BR><BR>The junta has been given many chances. It is 12 years 
since the
election<BR>in which Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for 
Democracy
won<BR>over 80% of the parliamentary seats. They are the elected 
government,
yet<BR>still the generals sit there, ignoring that result. And the world 

waits.<BR>It is time for the world to wake up. The United Nations, the 
U.S.,
Britain<BR>and other democratic nations now need to consider direct 
intervention
to<BR>restore democracy and peace to Burma.<BR><BR>First the world 
should knock
on Beijing's door. China is Burma's best --<BR>and almost only -- 
friend. China
has armed the junta and invested heavily<BR>in infrastructure and 
communications
equipment that help keep the junta in<BR>power. The international 
community
should show Beijing the photographs of<BR>mutilated Karen, Karenni and 
Shan
villagers, the pictures of burning<BR>houses and smoldering rice 
paddies, and
ask China why it arms such a<BR>regime. The world should urge China to 
cease
arming the junta and, more<BR>positively, to use its friendship with 
Rangoon to
influence the situation<BR>for good. If Beijing suggested to the 
generals that
they cease their<BR>brutal suppression of the ethnic minorities, the 
junta might
just listen.<BR><BR>Even if such a strategy didn't produce immediate 
results, it
could pave<BR>the way for international intervention. If Western nations 
sent in
troops<BR>without seeking China's help, Beijing would undoubtedly 
furiously
denounce<BR>this as interference in Burma's internal affairs. But if the 
world
sought<BR>China's help first, it would give Beijing some "face" -- 
recognition
that<BR>its influence counts. And if China failed, or refused, to use
its<BR>influence, then Beijing would have fewer grounds for complaint 
about
any<BR>subsequent international intervention. The world could then say
to<BR>Beijing: "We asked you to help and you failed, so we have to do
it."<BR><BR>The common objection to intervention is that it is 
interference in
the<BR>domestic affairs of a sovereign state. But that is a pathetic
argument<BR>when the regime that currently rules that state is 
illegitimate. As
one<BR>Karen military commander told me recently, "How can genocide, the 

killing<BR>of innocent civilians, continuing human rights abuses, rape,
looting,<BR>destruction be an 'internal matter'? It is an international 
matter."
Burma<BR>shares a border with Thailand, where many of the Karen and 
Karenni
have<BR>fled. Burma is tied up in the drugs trade, which the Karen and 
others
have<BR>been helping to fight. Both those factors, as well as the human
suffering<BR>involved, make it an international matter.<BR><BR>Military
intervention in Burma wouldn't be as difficult as some may 
think.<BR>Blockade
Burma for a week, and give the regime time to think. If there 
is<BR>still no
change, send in a few hundred troops, with ethnic rebel armies,<BR>and 
invite
Burmese soldiers to defect. Offer defectors blankets, food and<BR>the 
hope of
peace, and many would switch sides. The pack of cards in<BR>Rangoon 
would
collapse.<BR><BR>Burma under the military junta is no different from 
Afghanistan
under the<BR>Taliban, Kosovo under Slobodan Milosevic or East Timor 
under
Indonesian<BR>occupation. The same grotesque human rights violations 
occur on a
daily<BR>basis. If NATO could act against Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo, 
and
the<BR>U.S. and its allies could intervene against the Taliban in
Afghanistan,<BR>why treat the Burmese junta differently? The precedent 
is there,
the<BR>capability is there, the moral justification is there -- now the
political<BR>will is needed.<BR><BR>Mr. Rogers is a free-lance 
journalist and
founder of the human rights<BR>group Christian Solidarity Worldwide in 
Hong
Kong. He has recently been on<BR>his third visit to the Thai-Burmese
border.<BR><BR><BR><BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=
