      <p class="page_title"><b>A Free Burma Housewife Reports from the Mae Tao 
        Clinic </b>
      <p>In February 2005 I had the opportunity to spend a morning at the Mae 
        Tao clinic on the Thai/Burma border. I was with two doctors from the United 
        States who had come over to volunteer for a week at the clinic. Both of 
        these doctors are specialists, an OB/GYN and a surgeon. They are both 
        incredibly gifted and committed. That morning, I joined the OB/GYN in 
        the reproductive health unit of the clinic as she did her rounds with 
        the medics based at the clinic and a medical student. I also hoped to 
        observe an operation the surgeon was performing later. Grabbing a camera, 
        I decided I could at least take some pictures of the doctors working on 
        the patients and be useful at documenting the work if nothing else. 
      <p> The medics and OB/GYN as well as the medical student stopped to examine 
        a 29-year-old woman who was 32 weeks pregnant and dying from HIV/AIDS. 
        They discussed her case and listened to the heartbeat of the baby inside. 
        I thought I should quickly take some pictures and move on to see the surgery 
        next door. But then I looked at her and saw she was so small and weak. 
        The camera was set on telephoto and as I focused the lens on the scene 
        I saw this woman’s face for the first time. 
      <p> <img src="/IDX/Prayer/Day_of_Prayer/2006/Images/thu%20zar%20aung.jpg" width="378" height="266" align="left" alt="Thu Zar Aung">She 
        was beautiful, but her eyes seemed so full of pain. As the medical team 
        moved to the next patient, I walked over to the dying woman and asked 
        her in her own language if she would like prayer (I do not know very much 
        of the Karen Language but am grateful that I had at least remembered how 
        to say this). 
      <p> I was not prepared for the emotions that hit us. She looked up at me 
        with intensity, even as her body lay weakened and still, grasped my hand 
        tightly, and then she closed her eyes and nodded. I began to pray for 
        her in English. Tears flowed down her face and mine and I asked forgiveness 
        for my pride and lack of compassion. I was ashamed of my arrogance and 
        hurried activity. I could not move and just sat there with her, holding 
        her hand, as she rested her head against my hip. 
      <p> Many thoughts entered my mind. “Where did she come from? What had happened 
        to her and how does a doctor or medic handle this every day here? What 
        should I do? I don’t even know her name. She may die any time now and 
        her baby as well, with no one here to be with her in a close way.” I was 
        struck deeply by her suffering and her courage. Leaving her was the hardest 
        thing for me to do, but I prayed that she would find peace and comfort. 
        She reminded me how much God cares for each individual no matter what 
        his or her condition, and that in the moments we are given to walk side 
        by side someone in Love, we learn Truth. She has deeply touched my heart 
        -- I will never forget her. After I returned to the United States I emailed 
        Paw Htoo (nurse and medic who helps the Free Burma Rangers relief efforts) 
        and asked her if she could check on this woman for me. She did, and told 
        me that her name was Thu Zar Aung and she was dying and the baby had been 
        taken by cesarean section. Paw Htoo said that the baby weighed only 1.8 
        kilos. My heart sank as I thought that both mother and baby would die. 
      <p> <img src="/IDX/Prayer/Day_of_Prayer/2006/Images/aung%20aung.jpg" width="455" height="331" alt="Aung Aung" align="left">Six 
        months later when I returned to that town, Paw Htoo said to me, “The baby 
        is alive, I know where he is, do you want to see him?” She proceeded to 
        tell me that the mother had died not long after he was born and she only 
        discovered recently that the baby was alive and doing well and living 
        with a medic and his family near the clinic. We drove to the clinic and 
        found the boy nearby. He is beautiful, 6 months old, and healthy. They 
        said he had one HIV test that had come back negative, but was scheduled 
        for another one on 10 September. 
      <p> To see and hold this boy, little Aung Aung, whom I thought had died, 
        filled me with tremendous joy and hope. For this miracle encourages my 
        heart to remember what it means to love and pray, and that even through 
        great suffering there is new life and new depths and new joys to be discovered. 
        Sometimes we may feel unable to help or make a difference but with God’s 
        help we can always love and pray. 
      <p> Thank you all and God bless you, 
      <p> A Free Burma Housewife, August 2005
