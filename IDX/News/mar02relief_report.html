  BURMA. </h3>

          FEBRUARY-MARCH 2002

      </h3>

      <h4>

          GENERAL:

      </h4>

      <p>

          From 24 February to 12 March 2002, a relief team (FBR), conducted a

         humanitarian relief mission to internally displaced Karen in the

         northern Karen State of Burma. Due to the attacks of the Burma Army

         there are over 2 million people displaced inside Burma. In the

         Northern Karen State alone, (Toungoo, Papun, Nyaunglebin and Thaton

         districts), there are now over 4,000 new internally displaced persons

         (IDP).

      </p>

      <p>

          The Burma Army attacks, loots and burns villages and IDP hiding

         places every year, with the latest attacks in the Northern Karen State

         commencing in November 2001 and continuing up to this date, March 22

         ,2002. Please see attached update. In the area the relief team visited

         there are now over 3,000 new IDPs. The team distributed medicine, cash

         assistance for food, school supplies, bibles, hymnals, cassette tapes,

         clothes, solar panels and Good Life club packs for children.

      </p>

      <p>

          The team attempted to give love and hope to the villagers and IDPs in

         this area, holding clinics, training medics as well as joining the

         IDPs in worship services. The team was able to treat over 2,360

         patients among the IDPs. The primary diseases encountered were

         malaria, ARI, ERI, dysentery, skin infections, and malnutrition.

         Victims of knife (accidental), gunshot and landmine wounds ( all by

         Burma Army), were also treated. The Burma Army is very active at this

         time, patrolling, laying landmines and attacking villages and IDP

         hiding places. The relief mission report follows.

      <p>

          Last attack by SPDC November 11, 2001. 200 BA soldiers attacked the

         school and nearby village wounding one villager, ransacked and burned

         homes. Most villagers were attending church or just leaving church as

         attack began. Most villagers fled without being able to gather any

         personal items or property. As villagers fled into the mountains above

         the village the BA mortared their escape routes with 60mm and 81mm

         mortars. Homes not burned were looted and damaged beyond repair. 300

         villagers have fled. The school was torn apart and all school

         materials looted or destroyed. School text books and hymnals were used

         by Burma Army to clean themselves after defecating.

      </p>

      <p>

          Reports that the Burma Army (BA) are most active during rice harvest

         time. BA either steals or burns rice. BA are forcing IDPs to porter

         crew served weapons for them and construct roads. They are required to

         do this without pay and often without food. The BA officers eat first,

         soldiers second and if there is anything left the porters eat. One

         porter said that he got 5 spoonfuls of rice per day.

      </p>

      <p>

          Guh Gu reports that the BA continues to attack the Karen people,

         inflicting more death, destruction of homes and villages and

         displacing more people daily. The SPDC is systematically reducing the

         size of the Karen Nation. He feels strongly that his nation needs the

         following immediately:

          Interview with a porter/deserter who escaped from the Burma Army.

      </p>

      Sei Hein Thu: 20 years old, Lin Kein village. Shan Ethnic 

      <p>

          Sei reports that in July 2001 he was working on his family farm

         cutting bamboo. He was approached by the Burma Army (BA), at gun

         point. He was forced to porter rice and ammunition. He reports it was

         quite clear to him that he did not have a choice. Four more villagers

         from his area were captured and forced to porter as well. He reports

         they traveled 30 miles the first day. Officers and soldiers were fed

         first and if there was any food left the porters could eat. Reports

         that often he ate less than a handful of rice each day. He witnessed

         brutality of BA daily - particularly beatings for little or no reason

         (asking for food or water). On December 7, 2001 three porters from his

         village approached him and asked him if he wanted to escape with them.

         He was too afraid and declined. On December 8, 2001, while the SPDC

         were not looking the three porters fled. The escape was quickly

         discovered . The SPDC hunted them down and shot and killed all three

         as an example to the other porters. Sei reports seeing the dead bodies

         before being forced to continue on. The porters were told by Captain

         Tun Tun BA Light Infantry Battalion #525 &ldquo;just do as you are

         told or this could happen to you&rdquo;.

      </p>

      <p>

          Two weeks later the porters were sent to Ban Bong. They were given a

         choice to go home or join the SPDC. Sei choose to go home. The next

         day he was taken to see Captain Tun Tun. He was asked to join the

         SPDC. He informed Captain Tun Tun he was not interested. The Captain

         slapped him . The Captain was upset and claimed that Sei had told his

         soldiers he wanted to join the BA. He was then given a choice of

         joining the BA or going to jail. He choose to join the BA.

      </p>

      <p>

          After 10 days of training camp they had little or no food or water.

         Every time they went into the jungle to void or defecate they had to

         remove all of their clothing to insure they would not run away.

      </p>

      <p>

          During the training, a trainee tried to escape. The training officers

         forced the 200 trainees to severely beat the escapee. He was so

         severely beaten that he had to be hospitalized for two weeks. He was

         then forced to pay for his medical treatment. If the trainees did not

         participate in the beating of the escapee they were beaten by the

         training officers with bamboo canes.

      </p>

      <p>

          Sei was sent to Pa Knu Khu Line Infantry Battalion #256 for two

         months. He was then sent to Tau Ggy as a guard for the battalion

         commander. He reports that he began looking for an opportunity to

         escape.

      </p>

      <p>

          Finally, one morning at 5:30 a.m., while on guard duty he fled. He

         moved through the jungle for 9 days with little or no food. He

         eventually came upon villagers. He explained his situation to them. He

         gave them his weapon and they took him to a KNU location. He is no

         longer afraid of the BA catching him. He said he hates the BA for what

         they did to him and his villagers. He feels they are oppressing the

         people. He simply wants to go to Thailand and enter a school. He hopes

         to return to his family someday.

      Interview of four defenders of November 11, 2001 attack on Kew Mu Der,

      Baw Kaw and Te Tho lo. Defenders: Saw Shell 45 years old Saw Ha Shwe 32

      years old Saw Eh Moo 28 years old 

      <p>

          On November 11, 2001, while attending church services, the villagers

         were alerted that the BA were in the area. Saw Shell, Saw Ha Shwe, and

         Saw Eh Moo decided to patrol the immediate area . Almost immediately

         they made contact with the BA. The weapons fire signaled the villagers

         to flee the area. The BA column numbered 200-250 soldiers. The Karen

         soldiers were able to slow the movement of the BA column due to them

         passing through a narrow ravine. Thus allowing villagers time to flee.

         Most villagers could not return to their homes and fled with only what

         they were wearing. The BA pressed the attack. Upon reaching the

         village, the BA called in 81mm mortar strikes on the escape routes of

         the villagers as they fled into the mountains.

      </p>

      <p>

          The men report the battle lasted 2 1/2 hours. They report another

         soldier who fought with them was wounded in the leg and evacuated to

         another location. His name is unknown to this reporter.

      </p>

      <p>

          These men report that they will not move to refugee camps. This is

         their state. They will evacuate if need be but will always return.

         They only want to live their lives peacefully with their families in

         their villages.

         <strong>November 11, 2001</strong> the KNU security element protecting

         the Bilin river area and a nearby IDP hide site were attacked by the

         BA. 3000 people were displaced on both sides of the river. IDPs fled

         into the mountains and hid in the jungle. Most returned to their

         villages on November 25, 2001. One soldier was wounded defending his

         village and one villager killed (Po The Htoo) leaving a wife and 2

         children. Two villagers have disappeared it is unknown if they were

         killed or captured. BA suffered 2 KIA and 2 WIA. A Burma Army

         helicopter evacuated the two WIA.

          Current BA activity 20 miles away in southwestern part of district.

      </p>

      <p>

          Radios are needed to better communicate to villagers movement of BA.

         This would give villagers more warning time to flee with belongings.

          General Sha Minn of the KNU,&rdquo; Burmese government is telling the

         world that they love all ethnic groups . But their actions against our

         people show the real truth.&rdquo; The General wants the world to know

         the truth. The General wants the United States and Great Britain to

         punish the Burmese government. He reports Burma is the largest

         producer of methamphetamines in Asia and the largest producer of

         heroine in the world.

         life was saved by the intervention of the medics. She had a acute

         respiratory infection, bleeding from the nose and vagina and was

         panels, tapes and other gifts. Please continue to pray for the IDPs

         who are still inside Burma and living in uncertainty and fear. Their

         faith and love in the face of extreme hardship and oppression is an

         inspiration to us. We thank God for these people and pray for justice,

         freedom and peace for them and all the people of Burma.
