      <h1>From Karen: </h1>
      <h3>Christmas 2005</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for your prayers and encouragement through this
time of Sahale's illness.  I have truly needed all the prayers you
have sent for our family.  I came on the trip this year with great
hope in God's love, but weak in faith for His provision and I
entertained too many doubts and fears, especially for our new baby,
Peter- 3 weeks old when we started walking in. This in itself was
blinding and seemed to cripple my ability to 'stand firm', even
before Sahale became sick.  After one day of great struggle and
despair, God opened my eyes, and as I saw my children playing with
their 'uncles and aunts' (teachers at the training), I was at once
reminded of my vision and purpose for being here. The fear I had been
carrying dissolved instantly.  Reading Hebrews 11 & 12 was great
encouragement to me.  The following day was when Sahale started to
have a fever, which continued for over 3 weeks.  All along, but
especially from 11/20 on, I have been lifted up by God's great hand
of mercy and, through your prayers, was reminded of a few things that
gave me peace during our times of greatest concern for Sahale's life.
I hope that God will redeem my weaknesses in some encouragement for
you.<p><p>Vision:  As Jeremiah 29:11 says, God has a hope and a future for us,
and to remember the vision he gives us is victory.  When I was
reminded of the vision I have for my children (to experience a very
unique love and understanding of generosity, hospitality, simplicity,
and compassion), my feet seemed to find solid ground again.  I was
also reminded that in this 3rd year of coming here I am in the
'middle of the race (Heb. 12:1)', a long term investment, and should
not lose heart.  From that time on, as Sahale's condition worsened,
that vision carried me through, especially in the words of Jesus, 'do
not be afraid of that which kills the body, rather be afraid of that
which kills the soul'.  I felt that every step we had taken in this
work, and in bringing our children here, was good and true, and that
I had done everything I believed could 'secure their souls' for
eternity together with God, and us too.  Of course, they will make
their own decisions about what we have offered, but for my part, I
have no regrets, as long as I hold fast to that vision.<p><p>Trust:  The familiar words in Proverbs 3:5&6 spoke the loudest to me
as Sahale's treatment moved to the level beyond basic antibiotics and
a common infection, where a diagnosis was very difficult without a
laboratory test.   I was to trust in God with ALL my heart.no dark
and dusty corners of fear and doubt could remain.  And, I was NOT to
lean on my own understanding.  It was very freeing (though not always
easy) to remind myself not to try to understand and make decisions
for my daughter when 3 skilled doctors were with us.  Doctors, Michel
and Mitch were never more than 5 minutes away and graciously answered
every question and investigated every concern I had about her
illness, as well as reading and studying everything they had in print
to find a diagnosis. And we had medical and spiritual support via
long range communications with Dr. Trevor and Heather Smith as well
as Dr. Sandra Bierling.  At one point here, a Karen lab tech carried
a microscope and basic blood test materials for 2 days to see us and
give us information on the level of bacterial/viral cells. The Karen
woman who tested Sahale was one of the first FBR medics we trained
and we had not seen her in 4 years. The tests showed her blood was ok
and that her body was still fighting well.<p>
Inside 'trust' were the words 'commit and honor'.  I felt that
through everything God would give a testimony of love, and one part
of that was to show our children our commitment to the people here by
including them in our prayers and decisions and honoring their words.
I told myself that I would honor the Karen doctor's recommendations
as he is one of the most skilled medics in the Karen State and
familiar with this area and illnesses here, even though my greatest
inclination was to go to the technology I am most familiar with,
Thailand.  God also helped me lay the decision to stay or go at the
table before our Karen team for their advice also.  It is not always
easy to trust others with advice about your children, even if you
know they love them as their own and pray to hear the voice of God
also.  But, Proverbs 3:5&6 said that God would direct our path if I
trusted him with all my heart and committed and honored the people we
came to serve.<p>
On Dec.7, after 3 weeks of fighting the sickness with multiple
antibiotics and no improvement we came to the conclusion that Sahale
probably had typhus and we needed to put her on the only available
but potentially dangerous antibiotic, chloramphenicol. At this point,
faced with her lack of improvement and the potential side effects of
the new antibiotic, we met and prayed again. Then based on the
doctors' recommendations, our joint team prayer and Sahale's
deteriorating condition, we decided Dave would send us back to
Thailand. He would then return to continue the training of the new
relief teams.  He gave instructions at the camp and put our Karen
brother Gideon in charge and we walked the first day. We decided we
had to start the first step back, praying that she would begin a
recovery enroute and that we could turn back to the camp again. We
still had hope.<p>
At this point your prayers strengthened me again as at the last
minute she showed an amazing though still slight improvement as Dave
was carrying her. Arriving at a village midway back she began to
improve noticeably. It was amazing, and then she improved enough that
doctors Michel and Mitch both agreed that the chloramphenicol was
working and that she was on the road to recovery. To continue the
trip to out would cause unneeded stress. This was amazing and
wonderful.  The new anti-biotic was working and it would be good to
wait at the village where we had stopped and when Sahale became
stronger to return to our home at the camp.  Although this was good
news, most of all I wanted Sahale's health and wellness. To stop
moving towards what I felt was greater control in technology and
tests and to trust and honor our dear team and doctors, was very
difficult for me. We decided to stay and thanked God.  At this point
Dave, who never gives up assumed the primary nurse duties for the
following 3 days we stayed at that village until her fevers and
nausea were gone. We then returned to camp.<p>
The training continued very well and there was a great feeling as we
reunited with our staff and the new teams. Two weeks later, on
December 23 we graduated and sent out the new teams to help their
people. On Christmas Eve we traveled.
Sahale on her horse 'Spirit' and Suu on her mule, 'Malibu'- gifts
from you all and part of our 22 horse/mule pack team for carrying
relief supplies. Actually, Dave carried one of the girls most of the
way as one of our Kachin team members came down with malaria as we
walked and we put him on Malibu. He is now recovering.<p>
Emmanuel:  Christmas is my favorite season.filled with excitement
about 'advent', God coming to meet us personally.  My testimony is
threefold.  Once during each of the times when Sahale was the sickest
I seemed to follow her up to the edge of a cliff overlooking the
valley of death and watch her feeble body teeter on the edge about to
fall off.in each case God would take our hands in his, turn us
around, and draw us back to a peaceful resting place.<p>
I know that only God knows the number of days we will have on this
earth together and so in this way each day and moment is a precious
gift.  Christmas is the promise that even though our physical bodies
will all die, our spirits will be together forever because of God's
love in sending Jesus.<p>
One of my greatest prayers for our children is that they
would have the gift of knowing a personal relationship with God early
on in their childhood.  I believe there is something very special
about meeting God when you are young that will cement a belief in
what is true despite the pitfalls of adolescence and adulthood.  Dave
had a very real touch from God when he will ill with Dengue fever and
at boarding school away from his family during his 2nd grade year.  I
do not know yet what impact this experience will have had on Sahale's
spiritual life, but I pray that God has come to be even more real
through it all.<p>
Emmanuel is also about meeting God in others and time and
time again I have been uplifted by the love of those who helped us.
On the initial walk to the camp I had a very difficult time carrying
Peter over one tedious section.  Returning over that same place
(twice now), Atee had been carrying him for me and I hardly
remembered my anxiety of the first time.  Emmanuel was also the many
people who took loving care of Suuzanne while I was full time with
Sahale and Atee was caring for Peter.  Thinking back to Suuzanne's
malaria last year, the stakes were much higher this year as we could
not find the cause and Sahale was not responding to the medicines we
tried. But in God's provision, so did have two great doctors, Michel
and Mitch to be with us. Amy provided much strength and peace.<p>
The day after they left us, Eliya, our team chief medic (and one of our son's namesakes) and another top medical
professional (who had recently treated 5 cases of typhus including
one fatal case), arrived to where we were staying, along with Doh
Say, who, despite being an adult, is one of her best friends.
Emmanuel is the team we work with and their love for our family and
their great compassion for their people in that many have not even
seen their own families for a long time in their work serving the
IDPs.  So many of them have endured so much worse with so much less
than we have. Having Nathan's support  and abilities to handle anything
he was asked to do was also a great blessing.<p>
Emmanuel is the doctors and Dave seeing the vision for
Sahale's recovery here when I didn't have the faith for that new
step, and for Dave taking over the nursing duties and having a very
special time with Sahale sitting by her mat for 3 days.<p>
Emmanuel is Partners, Tuesday night prayer group, Kevin Austin, our team
and you all praying in concert.  Finally, Emmanuel is all of you spending
time praying for us, giving advice and encouragement and love on our
behalf from all over the world.  I pray that God meets you richly
this season as well and that your 'presents' are made of treasure of
heaven that will remain with you eternally.  God bless you and may
your new year ring of victory in God's goodness!<p><p>Karen<p>John 10:1
