<h2>Update-fighting in Paan District,Karen State and IDPs</h2>
<h4>Source: CCB</h3>
<h4>Date: 10.17.2003</h3>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>On the night of October 15, 2003, SPDC forces (12 
Burma Army Battalions and 3 DKBA battalions), supported by 120mm, 81mm and 60mm 
mortars, took control of the Mae Ple Do valley and part of the Eastern Dawna 
Range (west of Mae La, Thailand). The KNLA defenders withdrew and are 
reorganizing their forces. The&nbsp;SPDC forces have now arrived on the banks of 
the Moei river near the KNLA 7th Brigade HQ (now abandoned). The SPDC forces 
suffered over 150 casualties(killed and wounded),&nbsp;and the KNLA have 
suffered&nbsp;15 wounded. Over 300 prisoners are being used by the SPDC forces 
in this offensive, as porters and as human minesweepers. At least three verified 
deaths have occurred when prisoners stepped on landmines as they were forced to 
advance in front of the Burma Army troops. Escaped prisoners report many more 
deaths from other mine incidents and beatings by the Burma Army.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>There are still over 1,500 IDPs&nbsp;(over 400 
families), in the upper Mae Ple Do valley. They fled there after the SPDC began 
this offensive in August. Relief teams were able to reach them earlier, but at 
this time due to the occupying SPDC forces,it is not possible for teams to get 
through the SPDC lines. Relief teams will however,&nbsp;continue to find ways to 
reach the IDPs. These IDPs have remained in hiding and do not desire to go to 
Thailand as they hope to able to return to their farms and&nbsp;their rice crops 
which will soon be ready for harvest. They are hoping&nbsp;that the SPDC will 
retreat or will be unable to control this entire area. The KNLA do have some 
forces remaining in this area and are providing limited protection for these 
IDPs. The area is heavily mined and it is difficult for anyone to move at this 
time.</FONT></DIV>
