      <h3>
          Situation Report Of The Northern Karen Districts:<br>
         1 November 2001
      </h3>
      <p>
          This report is a brief update on the situation in northern Karen
         state. It was completed after a relief mission to the internally
         displaced people (IDPs) in these areas. The Burma Army continues its
         attacks against the Karen people of Papun, Taungoo and Nyaunglebin
         districts (northern Karen state, Burma), destroying rice supplies,
         torturing and executing villagers, looting villages, relocating people
         by force, conducting forced labor, and terrorizing the population by
         the systematic laying of landmines throughout each district. This has
         resulted in an increase in the numbers of internally displaced in
         these areas as well as a potential increase in refugees who may arrive
         in Thailand due to this displacement.
      </p>
      <h3>
         PAPUN DISTRICT
      </h3>
      <p>
         37,007 Karen remain displaced in Papun district while over 50 villages
         remained forceably relocated. Many IDPs from Nyaunglebin, Taungoo and
         Thaton districts are still in Papun district since they fled thier
         districts during Burma Army attacks last year. This has put a strain
         on the people of this district as they struggle to help feed these new
         arrivals from thier own stocks. Over 1,000 IDPs from Nyaunglebin (of
         the 2,000+) who fled between Nov 2000 and Feb 2001, remain in Papun
         district, while an additional 1,000 IDPs who had hoped to remain in
         this area had to go to refugee camps in Thailand due to the shortage
         of food.s The SPDC continues its work on the Kauk Kyi to Saw Hta road
         using forced labor from nearby villages. The road is outposted every
         200 meters and mines have been planted all along both sides of the
         road. The road itself is an unimproved dirt road currently only usable
         in the dry season (Dec-June). It connects Saw Hta on the Salween river
         to the east with the town of Kauk Kyi 100kms to the west.
      </p>
      <p>
          The Burma Army is currently resupplying thier units in Papun district
         with rice for an expected dry season offensive. With over 20 Burma
         Army battalions in the area the people live in fear yet they
         perservere. The Karen Army continues to provide protection for the
         villagers and IDPs as well as they can and schools and churches in
         Papun district function well. Relief teams provide limited assistance
         and the district's clinics meet some of the peoples' basic needs.
         "Please find a way for us", was the plea of one IDP.
      </p>
      <h3>
          NYAUNGLEBIN DISTRICT
      </h3>
      <p>
          The people of Nyaunglebin were some of the hardest hit by the Burma
         Army's 2000-2001 offensive. Over 2,000 IDPs fled into Papun district
         between November 2000 and February 2001. 13,000 IDPs remain in central
         and eastern Nyaunglebin district and 370,000 are displaced in
         relocation sites in the western lowlands of the district. Of the
         13,000 IDPs in the central and eastern areas, 5,450 are from Mone,
         3550 from Ler Doh and 4,000 from Hsaw Hti townships. They fled because
         of the forced labor and "special" taxation as well as direct attacks
         of the Burma Army.
      </p>
      <p>
          Since November 2000, 83 villages were forced to move to 12 relocation
         sites. Forced labor is practiced by the Burma Army on the road project
         between Shwygin in the southwest and Bye Gyi Ma They in central
         Nyaunglebin district. The road is not yet complete. Around the larger
         towns and villages of the district, the SSS or "short pants", ( terror
         squads that work to intimidate villagers and execute suspected KNU
         supporters), continue to operate, terrorizing the populace. These
         units are controled directly from Rangoon and operate independantly
         from the local commands.
      </p>
      <p>
          15 Battalions of the Burma Army conduct operations in the district
         with orders to "destroy all rice supplies and disrupt the population
         in the mountains". They were also ordered to attack villages and IDP
         hide sites, but were given the order, " do not burn down the houses
         because human rights organizations are will take photographs and
         accuse us".
      </p>
      <p>
          In September 2001, as 10 IDP families were attempting to flee the Mae
         Yae area, Burma Army troops captured them and sent them to the
         relocation site at Win Maung on the Bilin river. Win Maung is a major
         main forced relocation site along the southern border area of
         Nyaunglebin and Papun districts. The following villages were forced to
         move to another relocation site at Ma Way (north of Win Maung, also on
         the Bilin river) ; Wah Tho Ko,Ler Wah Ko,Klo Kee, Pwa Ya Kee, To Ko
         Kaw Kee, Day Law Po,Mae Tha Ko Hta and Wah Tho Lo. While a relief team
         was in the area in Ocober 2001, Burma Army units attacked a village,
         and close by, shot a 16 year old villager who was gathering
         firewood.This same relief team also came across the skeletons of two
         porters (one of whom was beaten to death), who were used by the LIB
         367 and LIB 368 commanded by Ltc. Ko Ko Aung, and then left to die,
         during thier November 2000 offensive in this area. In this district,
         since November 2000, 50 villagers have been killed by the Burma Army,
         over 100 injured during attacks and 20 women raped.
      </p>
      <p>
          In spite of this, the people of Nyaunglebin district have not given
         up and continue to rebuild thier lives and farms. Where this is not
         possible they have moved deeper into the mountains to start new
         villages. Here they have also reopended thier schools and as of
         November, 2001, there are 27 primary schools and 3 middle schools in
         operation. There are also mobile clinics and a public health program
         in place. The churches too continue to function as places of worship
         and hope as well as providing social organizations that provide
         assistance to the people.
      </p>
      <h3>
          TAUNGOO DISTRICT
      </h3>
      <p>
          The IDP population of Taungoo district is now over 9,600 and with a
         increase of Burma Army activity in the district (mainly related to
         forced labor for road construction), this number will probably
         increase.
      </p>
      <p>
          There are three major road projects ongoing in the eastern part of
         Toungoo district. Each of these road projects entail the use of forced
         labor. The SPDC is building a road from the city of Taungoo (site of a
         Divisional HQ), to the city of Mawchi in Karenni State. The road is
         not yet complete but when it is it will connect the two areas with a
         year around road. There are still 27 miles of unnavigable tract. (Near
         Mawchi in the Karenni State, the SPDC force villagers to do road work,
         however they do pay each village headman 8,000 kyat and 2 sacks of
         rice for each mile of road cleared-70 feet wide by 1 mile long. This
         amount must be divided among the entire village and the entire village
         must work. No villager willing works as this amounts to almost nothing
         per person. The work is not only difficult it also takes the villagers
         away from their fields and farms, jeapardizing thier harvest).
      </p>
      <p>
          The second road is from Toungoo to Siday in the southcentral part of
         Toungoo district. This road also serves Bu Sa Kee where a Stategic
         Command HQ is located. The third road is a branch road off the
         Taungoo-Mawchi road, that when complete will link Taungoo with
         Thandaung in the northeast. Thandaung is important as it quarters a
         Training HQ for officer, NCO, Land mine operations, guerrilla and SSS
         training programs. These roads in the north and central areas combined
         with the highway system to the west and the Kauk Kyi- Saw Hta road to
         the south, will when complete, enable the Burma army to exert greater
         pressure on the resistance forces as well IDPs hiding in the
         mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
          There are now 15 battalions operating in this district. They conduct
         road building security missions, patrols and sweeps to find IDPs. The
         smallest force they usually travel with is 30 men and most often they
         operate with no less than a column of 100 men. Each column has at
         least 1 60mm mortor, 2-5 RPG-7s, M91 rifle grenadiers, 1-3 crew served
         light 7.62 machineguns and 5.56 automatic rifles of Burma manufacture
         (copies of G-3s and AK 47s). NCOs often carry M1 carbines. They also
         carry locally produced MM1 and MM2 anti-personnel mines (copies of
         Chinese mines) as well as mines supplied by China.
      </p>
      <p>
          There is a contingent of SSS ("short pants"-terror units). The SSS
         operate in mobile teams of 10 men (each of these 10 man units belong
         to a larger mibile force of 65-85 men), terrorizing villagers with
         summary executions, brutal interrogations, and the planting of
         landmines on village paths suspected to be used by the resistant
         forces. Each team is equipped with automatic weopens as well as 2 land
         mines each to place as needed. "They have a list of suspects and enter
         the village at midnight, tie up the victim, torture and interrogate
         him, then take to the riverside and kill him, throwing his body in the
         river....this is very terrifying for the people...they also lay in
         wait and capture peopel on the way to the market and kill them if they
         have a flashlight or plastic sheet as these items are thought to be
         headed to Karen resistance soldier.....on July 24 near Yee Thu Gyi
         village they killed two men on the trail, Mr. Apollo age 30 and
         another man I did not know, they were only farmers not Karen
         soldiers.", statement by a Karen man,Mae Ii,age 60, from Taungoo
         district.
      </p>
      <p>
          Each battalion of infantry must supply 10-20 men for the SSS program
         which is under the direct control of General Maung Ne who is in turn
         under the command of General Khin Nyunt in Rangoon.
      </p>
      <p>
          There are 9 relocation sites around Taungoo and 6 new relocation
         sites. In one of the newest ones (Yee-Tha-Gong/ Klaw Mee Dur), the
         IDPs were forced to fence in the site, live under a curfew and are
         forced to provide labor for local road projects.This site is under the
         direct control of LIB 73. LIB 73 was also the battalion that on August
         27th looted Yee Da Gong village and stole all the money from the
         church. The 6 new sites are; Aung Myin Ywa , Tha Bya Nyu, Ye Tha Go,
         Daw Ga Li Gyi,Na Ka Mau, and Ya Za Ka. In the Thandaung area only one
         original village remains, the rest have been abandoned or their
         inhabitants forced to enter relocation sites. In the Tantabin area
         there are only 2 original villages remaining.
      </p>
      <p>
          As in the other Karen districts the people still resist the Burma
         Army and try not to be forced to leave thier homes. If they are forced
         to leave most try to hide in the mountains and to start new farms. IDP
         schools, clinics and churches continue to serve the people. There are
         3 mobile clinics, 50 primary schools, 3 middle schools and numerous
         churches. However, due to the strength of the Burma Army in the
         surrounding area as well as the heavily mined and almost uncrossable
         Kauk Kyi- Saw Hta road to south, it is very dangerous for anyone who
         does want to escape the area.
