         Persons fleeing attacks</a> of the Burma Army LIB 301 and 78 in
         Dooplaya District, Karen State. These Karen villagers are in a group
         of 96 (of the 5,000 displaced in this area) who are attempting to flee
         attacks of forced relocation by the Burma Army. They walked for 10
         days with the elderly, newborns, and sick making their progress slow
         and dangerous. The Burma Army shelled and chased and attempted to
         ambush them as they fled to Thailand.
