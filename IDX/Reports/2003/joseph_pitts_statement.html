      face=Arial>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this very important and timely hearing 
      to examine the current situation of human rights in Burma.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>The witnesses here today, as 
      well as organizations who have submitted statements for the Record, will 
      share only a glimpse of the horror experienced by the people of Burma at 
      the hands of the military dictatorship.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>As it is clear from so many past 
      and current reports, the situation is not getting better.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The military thugs use forced 
      labor, systematic rape, forced human landmine sweepers, destruction of 
      villages, destruction of food sources and fields, and cold-blooded murder 
      to impose its illegitimate reign over the people.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Unfortunately, the regime is not 
      held accountable for its widespread, deliberate human rights violations 
      against the people.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Sadly, 
      the international community has failed to act strongly to make it clear to 
      the military dictatorship that its time in power is coming to an 
      end.</FONT></P>
      <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><FONT face=Arial>The Burmese Freedom and 
      Democracy Act of 2003 is an important step in making clear the response of 
      the United States government to the violations of the Burmese 
      government.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>The 
      economic sanctions, freezing of financial assets, and visa restrictions 
      help increase the pressure on this regime.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However, the international 
      community needs to respond much more strongly.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is vital the United Nations 
      Security Council begin to address the many issues related to Burma and the 
      current ruling regime: human rights violations, its contribution to 
      regional instability, its leading role in drug production and trafficking, 
      its inaction to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, and other issues.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><FONT face=Arial>The regime’s shocking 
      attack in May against Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD members is a reflection 
      of its basic character.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I 
      strongly urge the regime to release Aung San Suu Kyi from prison.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Over the years, there has been 
      reported “progress” in establishing a United Nations -facilitated dialogue 
      between the NLD, the regime, and the ethnic groups.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Yet, each time there seems to be 
      progress, the regime commits human rights violations and sets the talks 
      back once again.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Recently, 
      the military dictatorship released a road map for Burma that includes 
      holding elections.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This road 
      map is just one more step to attempt to fool the world into thinking the 
      military thugs might be making progress, when it is simply another 
      delaying tactic to maintain its hold on power.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The fact that the regime is 
      proposing democratic elections is outrageous when it continues to ignore 
      the legitimate results of the 1990 elections and imprison the 
      democratically elected leader of the country.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: normal"><FONT face=Arial>Earlier this year, I 
      traveled to the Thai-Burma border to visit refugees and hear their 
      stories.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was 
      heartbreaking.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The conditions 
      of life that these refugees have fled, and their stories of the Internally 
      Displaced Persons (IDPs) who remain inside of Burma are shocking.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>In Thailand, my delegation 
      met with organizations working with refugees along the Thai-Burma border 
      and with the Internally Displaced People (IDPs) inside the jungles of 
      Burma.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The situation in Burma 
      is dire, and I would not hesitate to call it, according to international 
      legal definitions, genocide.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>In Article 2 of the 
      1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 
      genocide is defined as “any of the following acts committed with intent to 
      destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious 
      group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious 
      bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting 
      on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical 
      destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent 
      births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group 
      to another group.”<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Reports 
      make clear that the ironically-named State Peace and Development Council 
      (SPDC) of Burma, the ruling military junta, has engaged in a deliberate 
      policy to eliminate the ethnic minorities.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Sadly, the international community 
      has turned a deaf ear to the cries of the ethnic minorities, the refugees, 
      the IDPs, the democracy activists.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>There are a large number of organizations that carefully track the 
      violations in Burma so there is no shortage of evidence of the human 
      rights abuses the SPDC commits.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>The Karen Human Rights Group, the Shan Human Rights Foundation, the 
      Shan Women’s Action Network, the Committee for Internally Displaced Karen 
      People, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, Christians 
      Concerned for Burma, Partners Relief and Development, and many other Burma 
      groups produce reports of current and past atrocities committed by the 
      SPDC.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The stack of reports I 
      have with me today only represents a fraction of what is available. 
      <O:P></O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: normal"><FONT face=Arial>In the refugee camps 
      north of Mae Sot, Thailand, my delegation and with Karen refugees, 
      Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims who all had fled the attacks of the 
      SPDC on their communities.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We 
      saw landmine victims, orphans and school children, who all had suffered 
      from the actions of the SPDC.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>Our visit with the refugee orphans was both heart-wrenching and a 
      delight.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was a delight to 
      see these young children and to hear the songs they sang to us, but it was 
      heart-wrenching to hear the amount of tragedy in these young lives.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>One group of four children, the 
      oldest was 12, had lost their father; their mother could not take care of 
      them so she brought them to the orphanage.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>An eight-year-old boy, who could 
      not smile, had lost both parents, was then trafficked across the border to 
      Thailand, somehow escaped from his “owners,” and reached the safety of the 
      refugee camps.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>It is 
      heartbreaking to know that many of the young children, including the 
      orphans, in the refugee camps had watched family or community members 
      being killed by the SPDC, wounded or killed by landmine explosions, raped, 
      or even burned alive.<O:P> </O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial>The attacks on the people continue.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I recently received a report that 
      on September 11, 2003, 30 Karen families from Paan District fled to the 
      Thai border as a result of an offensive being carried out by Burmese 
      military troops.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>The plight of the 
      IDPs must be addressed at the highest levels of our government, other 
      governments and the United Nations.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>I commend our government’s support for programs assisting the 
      refugees and democracy groups.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
      </SPAN>However, I am dismayed at our lack of assistance to the IDPs.<SPAN 
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What is our government doing to 
      help the people living their lives on the run in the jungles, the people 
      who have no access to food, medicine, clothes, or even a basic 
      education?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>While the world 
      sits around debating whether or not Burma is important, or whether or not 
      pressure should be increased to continue the tri-partite dialogue, people 
      in Burma are dying.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Little 
      children are deliberately being raped and murdered by the Burmese 
      military.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What will 
      help?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Decisive 
      action.</STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><FONT face=Arial>The U.S. and the 
      international community need to press for the immediate and unconditional 
      release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the immediate and unconditional release of 
      all political and religious prisoners, send monitors to Burma, pursue 
      prosecution of those responsible for these crimes against humanity, press 
      for the immediate end to deportation of democracy groups back to certain 
      death in Burma, press strongly for the recognition of the democratically 
      elected government of Burma, and send international peacekeepers to 
      Burma.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><FONT face=Arial>Thank you again, Mr. 
      Chairman, for holding this hearing on human rights in Burma.<SPAN

      distinguished witnesses.</FONT></P>
