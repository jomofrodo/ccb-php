<p>Dear Friends, 

<p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Global Day of
Prayer for Burma. Thank you to all who have faithfully joined
with us in prayer and worked to bring hope and peace to
Burma.
<p>
Before there was a Global Day of Prayer for Burma there
was a group of friends who cared about Thailand and Burma.
They were doctors, pastors, poets and writers, teachers
- revolutionaries all, desiring to bring freedom to people
through the gospel and their respective work. They cared
for leprosy patients, young people, old people, handicapped
people, students, refugees, and families caught in the crossfire.
For the most part, their work was in Thailand, but it became
apparent to them that Burma's people, all of them, also were
in great need of prayer. And so they began to add Burma to
their prayers every Tuesday night, lifting up the people, the
politicians, the ethnic groups, Aung San Suu Kyi and the
democracy activists, the oppressed and poor....alongside their
many other ministries.

<p>This prayer for Burma, informal and independent as it
was, rose to a mission and annual date after David Eubank and
Laurie Dawson took a trip to Rangoon to hear Aung San Suu
Kyi speak in 1996, during a brief period of freedom for her in
between house arrests. Dave and Laurie heard her speak from
her front gate, stirring up in her oppressed people hope for
freedom. They too were stirred with hope, and love for these
people seemingly on the brink of freedom. They secured a
meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi, Dave met with her and she
told him: "We need unity. We will never have peace without
unity. And we need prayer. Please pray for us, and tell those
here in Burma especially, please pray for us. Don't be afraid
because, "Perfect love casts out fear."

<p>The final step was the encouragement of Dr. Saisuree
Chutikul, a friend of Joan and Allan's andalso of Aung San Suu
Kyi's. Dave came back to Thailand with the idea of praying for
Burma and then met Dr. Saisuree, a permanent senator in the
Thai government and an advocate for women's and children's
rights and trafficking victims. She said, "You should start a day
of prayer for Burma." And so it began.

<p>Please join us in praying for Burma on Sunday, March 12.

<p>We have made a prayer guide that is available on our website and there is a link to it below. 
This link is for an English language version of the prayer guide. Other translations are available on the website. Thank you for praying with us. 

<p>God bless you,

<p>Christians Concerned for Burma
