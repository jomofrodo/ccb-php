<!--<div id="Page"><table class="mainbodycell" width=100%><tr><td>-->Dear Friends, 
<p>Thanks to all of you who joined in the day of prayer for Burma on March 10, 
  2013. This was the 17th annual Global Day of Prayer for Burma, which started 
  with a request for prayer from Aung San Suu Kyi who is now free and is part 
  of the government of Burma. We believe that God works through prayer and leads 
  in love, and we want to be led by God's love for freedom, justice and reconciliation 
  in Burma. While many good changes are happening, there is still widespread oppression 
  and displacement in Burma and we are all grateful for your prayers.
<p>We thank God for all of you, from all over the world, who united on this day 
  to pray that God bring peace, justice and reconciliation to the people under 
  oppression in Burma. We are grateful for a family of prayer that stretches from 
  Alaska to Australia, from the Czech Republic to Afghanistan, from Karen State 
  to Scotland, and to countries in between. Your prayers and support help the 
  people here to know that they are not alone, and that when they stand for the 
  truth, they are not standing alone. Most of all, we believe your prayers have 
  direct impact on the situation and on peoples' hearts. God works through your 
  prayers and we see the results. As change comes there is a need for clarity 
  to see the true way forward and for courage to stand for that truth. A friend 
  inspired us with these words: "If God is not in the story, the story is not 
  true." Our continued prayer is for change that is of God.
<p>This year after the day of prayer, three of our team members asked to be baptized. 
  One of them, Nang Mo is, a Shan and is married to the leader of all the Shan 
  FBR relief teams. As she said, "Before I did not understand about God. Now I 
  know I belong to God and am content in my heart. I am happy." The other two 
  are foreign volunteers who were believers but wanted to be baptized in what 
  they described as, "An act of love and obedience to God." We are all blessed 
  to be part of this and thank God that as we work for change in Burma, God is 
  also bringing needed change in our own hearts.
<p>May we all change more and more to be the people and nations God made us to 
  be.
<p>God bless you,
<p>David Eubank and all of us here at Christians Concerned for Burma <!--</td></tr></table></div>-->
