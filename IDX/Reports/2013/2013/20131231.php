Dear friends,
<p>
Thanks for your prayers and help. Recently the Billy Graham Evangelistic
Association (BGEA), held an Abundant Life Festival in Chiang Mai. Leading up
to the festival I met with a friend named Eleanor who said, "It would be
great if some refugees could come to the event."
<p>
"Great idea," I said. "It would take a miracle, but we will pray and try."

<p>
The next day Pastor Simon, the founder and leader of Mae La Refugee Camp
Bible School, was in Chiang Mai. He had received a special pass to get out
of the refugee camp to attend a church meeting there. I asked him to come to
my house and told him about the Festival and asked him to come. "Why not
have the choir come too?" My wife Karen asked. This had never been done
before.
<p>
"Wow, that will take a big miracle, but let's pray and try."

<p>
I called Derek of BGEA right away and we prayed together on the phone. He
said, "Usually we plan these events well in advance, but let's try. Achan
Buacab, the Thai person in charge of all the local groups who will be
performing, will need to agree, but if she does we will do it."
<p>
"Yes, I know her, she is a good friend." I called Achan Buacab and asked her
about the choir and prayed with her.
<p>
"Yes, we have a slot that just came open," she said.
<p>
I told Pastor Simon the good news. He thanked God with me and said he would
need a letter from the BGEA to try to get permission for some of his choir
to come. The BGEA team and local Thai
church leaders, lead by Dr. Kiat, prepared the document. I left the day
after that for a relief mission and asked Hosannah on our team to help
coordinate the next steps.
<p>

A few days before the event was to start I heard that the permission was not
yet granted. In the camp where we were training, we all joined in prayer
each night for God to open the way for the choir to go to Chaing Mai and
attend the festival.
<p>
With only three days before the event, I asked Hosi to ask mom and dad (they
have been missionaries here for over 50 years), to help. They contacted a
Thai general friend who has helped us before for prostheses for landmine
victims.  He immediately contacted the local and regional authorities who
gave the initial permission needed but there were still other steps to take.
<p>
Rev. Kiat recalls the day before the event being awakened at midnight to
pray for the choir to make it. Then friends in Bangkok made a special effort
to get permission all the way through. It worked and at midnight, the start
of the first day of the festival, the choir, all 130 of them, arrived at our
house. We thanked God for all who helped get them there and for the
generosity and care of the Thai authorities at every level.
<p>
We came back off the mission for this, arriving home just before the refugee
choir. Hosi, Kit, Micah and the staff helped them fill every bit of our
home, the bunk house, Laurie's house and all the space in between. Also at
our house was the ACTs team, a 20-person church group led by Jeff Sutton
from the US.  They immediately volunteered to help us feed and take of the
refugee choir and served the first meal at 2 am.  Later on the Esh family
made a special spaghetti dinner for all.

The festival started the next day and went on for three days. Thousands of
people give their lives to Jesus and the refugee choir was amazing. "Who are
they?" the BGEA producers asked. "Where did they come from, they are world
class," many people said.

The Karen choir sang with great power and beauty and lifted all of us up
closer to the Lord. It was beautiful and I thanked God. Later one of the of
the Thai generals who helped us said, "I am grateful that God used me to do
something good. It was a privilege to be part of God's actions. It is
wonderful the choir made it here."
<p>
The festival itself was a powerful time of God's love and presence and I saw
thousands come forward to receive Christ. In all our years in Thailand we
have never seen any response of this scale. The morning of the last day, the
ACTS group from the US, performed a three-minute silent  play for the choir
at our home. It was about how we people can look for love and belonging in
the wrong places and be disappointed and how people can turn on us and
betray us, how Jesus comes to help, allows Himself to be abused and killed,
yet rises from the grave, scatters the darkness and saves us.

<p>
I was deeply moved by the play and prayed with Karen that somehow, even at
this late hour, we could have the group perform this play at the festival
this last night.
<p>
Later that day, Bob, from Decision magazine, came out to interview the choir
and helped me connect with JW, who was running the festival production. I
asked him about adding the play and he said, "Yes, let's go for it, as long
as our Thai partners are ok with the last minute change."
<p>
I called Achan Buacab again, we discussed this and prayed and she said, "Yes
we will find a way!"  Later that night I watched as thousands cheered the performance of
both choir and play.
<p>
On this last night Franklin spoke the simple, clear and powerful gospel
message of our need for forgiveness and how Jesus wants to forgive us, that
God sent Jesus to save us and help us be the people we were made to be. At
the  time of invitation, I  felt stirred to pray against the powers of
darkness and for Franklin's message and God's Spirit to penetrate to all
hearts here.

I looked up and at first saw only a few people coming forward. Then one by
one, two by two, then more and more started walking forward. Some were
crying, some were smiling, all came with the look of  purpose on their
faces. Soon more than a thousand people had come forward to give themselves
to Jesus. Counselors were with them up front to pray and it was a full and
happy throng.  By the end of the festival, over 4,000 people had made a commitment
to Jesus.
<p>
Later that night Derek and the BGEA staff gave us all the funds needed for
the transport and feeding of the refugees.
<p>
The next day after the 10 van load of refugees left our home to return to
their camp, I was grateful for God's power, timing and His love. "Good bye,
thank you, thank you, God bless you!" the choir called out as they smiled,
waved and disappeared around the bend. I am grateful for the choir, to all
who enabled them to get to the festival, to the Thai authorities, to the
church leaders of Thailand, to the BGEA and to God who cares for us all.
<p>
Love, Dave and family
