</ul>
<p>For thousands of villagers throughout Burma, running has become a part of everyday 
  life. They are forced from their homes. Their possessions and food are being 
  destroyed. They are unable to return to their homes for fear of being shot by 
  the Burma Army or maimed by landmines. Let us join together to show that those 
  who have the freedom to run have not forgotten those who have no choice but 
  to run.
<p>The event will include a 100 meter dash for small children and a 5k run/walk 
  including the popular Flip Flop division. Villagers often have to run wearing 
  only Flip Flops, see if you can do the same. Free pair to those who try. All 
  funds raised will go to help the Internally Displaced People (IDP's). 
<p>Any questions about the run can be directed toward <a href="mailto:run4relief@gmail.com">run4relief@gmail.com</a> 
  or by calling 0853-464404 
<p>Sponsored by Christians Concerned for Burma.
