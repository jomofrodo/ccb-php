<p>"When I first came to Southeast Asia, in 1991, I was not a Christian. In fact, 
  part of my reason for visiting Thailand was to study Buddhism. I still have 
  great respect for the Buddhist faith, which many of my friends follow. However, 
  God does move in mysterious and wonderful ways - when I returned to the UK six 
  years later, it was as a Christian! 
<p>Working with Karen refugees in Thailand, I was profoundly impressed by their 
  great faith. I remember meeting groups of Christians, huddling beneath trees 
  along the border, having been driven from their homes and lost all possessions 
  beyond those which they could carry on their backs. Nevertheless, their first 
  thought was to give thanks and praise to God. Not only were they asking for 
  His assistance, but they were praising him for the glories of life eternal, 
  despite the many sufferings experienced in this world. I was very moved by this 
  example of faith in practice. 
<p>As a result of the inspiring example of my Karen Christian brothers, and particularly 
  due to the influence of my fiancée (now wife!), I became a Christian in 1996. 
  At the time, I didn't fully appreciate what I was getting into. Although I was 
  baptized 'in good faith', I now realize that this was just the beginning of 
  a long journey, which I am still upon. In the years since I was baptized, my 
  faith has become increasingly central to the way I feel and think about my life. 
  Indeed, how could love of God not be the most important thing in one's life? 
  I'm so grateful to my Karen and other Christian brothers for leading me onto 
  this path. When my wife and I were married, it seems that I received two wonderful 
  gifts: my beautiful wife, and the gift of faith, and knowledge of God's love. 
<p>I visited Karen State again last November and December ('08). Although I had 
  traveled in Kaw Thoo Lei many times in the past, this was my first trip for 
  many years. The land is incredibly beautiful, with stunning (and steep!) hills 
  and mountains, and clear streams and rivers. There are a ample resources to 
  support the population - or would be, if not for the terrible ongoing armed 
  conflict. 
<p>I was repeatedly struck by how much people have suffered as a result of the 
  war. However, it was also truly inspiring to see the resilience of these Karen 
  communities - Christian and animist alike. Those who have not already fled are 
  determined to resist the pressures to displace them from their homeland. Their 
  resistance and determination is truly inspiring - as is the spirit of solidarity. 
<p>Despite the difficulties they face, the different villages we visited were 
  gracious and generous hosts. I was struck by the great love which binds these 
  communities together, and extends to those outsiders who have come to help. 
<p>In particular, the Free Burma Rangers were a great inspiration to me on this 
  trip. The selflessness with which the FBR teams expressed their Christian love 
  for fellow man and woman is something I had never experienced before. To me, 
  this is a wonderful example of faith in action. I am accustomed to the humanitarian 
  world, where aid agencies distribute assistance according to careful budgets. 
  Of course, this way of working is often very appropriate. However, the Ranges 
  take the spirit of charity further - giving as is needed, including from their 
  personal supplies, and also giving of their own love. As well as the spirit 
  of charity, the Rangers are shining examples of faith and hope, reminding the 
  suffering people of these remote parts of Burma that they have not been forgotten. 
<p>The generosity of spirit and bravery of the Rangers will be with me forever 
  as an example of Christian love. I thank God for the opportunity to have spent 
  time with them, and with my Karen brothers and sisters. 
<p>Thank you,<br>
  a friend from England
