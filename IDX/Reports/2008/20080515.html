<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p> Thank you for your prayers, donations and concern for those suffering in Burma. 
  The cyclone victims and those attacked and displaced by the Burma Army need 
  and appreciate prayers and help. 
<p>There is an immediate need for drinking water, sanitation, food, shelter, blankets, 
  cooking implements, medical care, logistical support and communications.
<p> Note: The military regime in Burma is actively obstructing relief efforts 
  of aid for those suffering as a result of Cyclone Nargis. 
<h2>Please pray for Burma: </h2>
<ol>
  <li>That the local relief network in Burma is able to respond effectively with 
    the necessary supplies and equipment to meet all the needs of the victims. 
  </li>
  <li>That the relief reaches those in need and is not blocked or diverted by 
    the Dictators. </li>
  <li> For the Internally Displaced People (IDPs). Even in the midst of the death 
    and destruction caused by the cyclone, in other parts of Burma, the Burma 
    Army continues to attack, kill and displace people. </li>
  <li>For medicine and other relief supplies for the 43 relief teams in the field 
    serving the IDPs under attack in Karen, Karenni, Shan and Arakan areas of 
    Burma. </li>
  <li>That the dictators in Burma have a change of heart, stop obstructing the 
    aid to cyclone victims, stop the attacks on Internally Displaced People in 
    other areas and begin the transition to a democratic, just and free Burma. 
  </li>
  <li>For spiritual freedom in Burma and for all people to know God's love.. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Cyclone Relief:</h2>
<p> Two of our partner organizations; the Free Burma Rangers, and Partners Relief 
  and Development are providing relief assistance through local networks in the 
  cyclone affected area.
<p> The Partners web site at : <a href="www.partnersworld.org">www.partnersworld.org</a> 
  outlines their relief work and how to support that work.<br>
  The Free Burma Rangers at <a href="www.freeburmarangers.org">www.freeburmarangers.org</a> 
  are working with Partners in the following areas: 
<ol>
  <li> The support of a local relief network operating in the affected Irrawaddy 
    Delta area, including Rangoon. This network is now providing emergency food, 
    water, medicine and shelter to as many victims as they can. </li>
  <li> The support and expansion of a communication and information network in 
    order to disseminate information, images and analysis of the situation. </li>
  <li>Prayer for those in need and encouragement of the local relief network. 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you and God bless you,
<p> Christians Concerned for Burma <br>
