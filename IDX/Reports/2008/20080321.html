<p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>Thank you for all who prayed for the people of Burma on the Global Day of Prayer 
  for Burma. We believe in the power of God through prayer, that changes our lives 
  and can change nations. We thank God that His Kingdom is everywhere and that 
  the light of love and hope shines in the darkness. </p>
<p>On March 9, 2008, people all over the world prayed for Burma on this the 11th 
  year of this global day of prayer. From the cities of Japan to the mountains 
  of Alaska, from the beaches of Thailand to the fjords of Norway, from the fields 
  of South Africa to the plains of Europe, from the jungles of South America to 
  the Pacific Islands; believers asked for God to intervene in Burma. We believe 
  that God is intervening and that God's purpose of redemption, love and salvation 
  is at work in Burma. 
        <p>The photographs in this message were taken at a prayer service inside Burma. 
          Here a team comprised of the Karen Youth Organization, Partners, Free 
          Burma Rangers, and Christians Concerned for Burma prayed with Christian 
          and Buddhists in a Buddhist village in the Karen State on March 8 and 
          9, 2008. A midnight candle light prayer service was held on the night 
          of the 8th, followed by prayer on the morning of the 9th. After this, 
          a Good Life Club program was held to encourage and assist the children 
          and families here.

        <p>We are thankful for Jesus who listens to our prayers and helps us to 
          be part of God's Kingdom of love, mercy, truth and justice on this earth. 
          We are grateful for reconciliation between us and God and how we are 
          then helped to be reconciled with others. We thank God for forgiveness 
          and salvation that gives us hope, joy and the strength to live the best 
          we can.         <p>Thank you and may God bless, have mercy on and lead us all, where ever we are 
          in the world.
