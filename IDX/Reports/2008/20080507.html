<p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>Thank you for your prayer and concern and thanks again for your prayers that 
  helped us to be free to continue this work.
<p>We are now trying to partner with friends in Burma to help people affected 
  by the cyclone, where there are reports of over 20,000 dead, over 40,000 missing 
  and 1 million displaced. 
<p>There is an immediate need for drinking water, sanitation, food, shelter, blankets, 
  cooking implements, and medical care. We are trying to develop a network to 
  assess the needs, purchase or order supplies, package them, transport and distribute 
  them in the most caring and efficient manner and account for and report on the 
  assistance. 
<p>We will keep you updated on the situation and how to meet the needs of people 
  affected by this disaster. We are so grateful for your care and how you are 
  ready to take action. We could not do any of this alone and we thank God for 
  all of you. By your messages of support, encouragement and willingness to help, 
  you inspire us and help us to better help those in need. 
<p>God bless you,<br>
  David Eubank<br>
  CCB
