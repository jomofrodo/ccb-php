          whose homes were</span><span class="bodyCopy">destroyed by the Burma 
          Army. They now live in an IDP site in the Northern Karen State of Burma. 
          They are also now the charter members of the Good Life Club-"God brings 
          good life", in this area. </span> </p>
        <p><span class="bodyCopy"> Naw Moo Day Wa, on the left was shot in the 
          stomach by Burma Army troops while she was harvesting her families rice 
          field four years ago when she was eight years old. She survived the 
          shooting but was in a coma for one week in a bamboo mobile clinic. We 
          sent her to Thailand later but the bullet was judged too dangerous to 
          remove. Her body has now walled it off and she is healthy and says she 
          feels no pain. She is back with her family in a IDP site and is in school. 
          </span> </p>
        <p><span class="bodyCopy"> The girl on the right is named Naw Sa Sakee 
          Wa. She was brought to us on a mission with a very serious intestinal 
          problem that needed immediate surgery. We sent her to Thailand for the 
          operation and now she is completely healed and well. </span> </p>
        <p><span class="bodyCopy"> While waiting for their treatment both girls 
          stayed in our home and we all became as family. We love them very much 
          and thank God for their lives. Now they are back in their homes and 
          it is wonderful to see them healthy and full of life. Their parents 
          brought the two girls to see us on this mission and to thank us. We 
          gave them the new Good Life Club t-shirts provided by Partners and had 
          a wonderful time with them. </span> </p>
        <p><span class="bodyCopy"> Thank you for your love and care for these 
          girls. </span> </p>

                      Using a network of indigenous field teams, FBR is able to 
                      carry out critical research into human rights abuses, casualties 
                      and humanitarian needs of people too often forgotten by 
                      the outside world. FBR provides medical, spiritual and educational 
                      resources for IDP communities as they struggle to survive 
                      Burmese military attacks. </span></p>
