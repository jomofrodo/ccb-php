<p> <span class="bodyCopy"></span></p>
<h4><span class="bodyCopy">Introduction:</span></h4>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"> Dear Friends of the Wa, </span> 
<p><span class="bodyCopy"> Thank you so much to all of you who care for the Wa 
  and have continued to help all these years. In 1908 the first Wa became Christian 
  and now 99 years later over 50,000 Wa are believers. In spite of many challenges 
  the church continues to grow and God’s light shines among the Wa and through 
  the Wa to others around them.We thank God for Kay Orsini who has been the volunteer 
  coordinator for the Wa work here. She is a blessing to us and helps by running 
  the administrative side of this work and most importantly, by sharing her life 
  and faith with the Wa people. She is with us on a year by year basis and we 
  are grateful to God. See photos about the Wa outreach attached below and additional 
  photos sent with a second email.</span> 
<p><span class="bodyCopy"> I (David), spend most of my time now on foot, on relief 
  missions with the Karen, Karenni and Shan displaced people. (You will receive 
  also our Eubank family letter about this past year, 2006). Because of the Wa 
  partnership with the Burma dictators in legitimate business as well as narcotic 
  production and trafficking, we have not been able to go to the Wa State since 
  2000. The Burma Army and Wa have a cease fire agreement that makes it difficult 
  to work in the Wa state due to Burma Army oversight. So we support the Wa pastors 
  and then go where we can, (that is into the other ethnic areas where the Burma 
  Army is conducting attacks against the Karen, Karenni and Shan people. It is 
  a Burma Army policy of shoot on sight but we can move with the ethnics who can 
  usually avoid the Burma Army). When I am in Thailand we meet with the Wa Christian 
  Fellowship to pray, assess the work, make plans and encourage each other. The 
  mission to the Wa continues despite obstacles.</span> 
<p><span class="bodyCopy"> <br>
  Narcotics, collusion with the dictators, and attacks on other ethnic groups 
  make the Wa an easy scapegoat. However the Wa people themselves have very little 
  choice and are but pawns in a deadly game. Animism continues to grip the people, 
  and the threat of attack by the Army of Burma’s dictators means that most Wa 
  live in uncertainty and fear. In spite of this, the church shines its light 
  of God’s love and freedom. And in spite of many obstacles, the church continues 
  to grow. Thank you for your part in that growth.<br>
  </span> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  Note (1): Lawa is the name used for the ethnic Wa in Thailand, but Wa is the 
  name of the language and of the people-group elsewhere in the region (Burma 
  and China). There are an estimated one million Wa people in Burma; 200,000 in 
  China; and over 100,000 Lawa (Wa) in Thailand.</span> 
<p><span class="bodyCopy"> Note (2): The Wa Christian Fellowship (WCF) is part 
  of the 18th District of the Church of Christ Thailand (CCT). The Wa pastors 
  on the WCF Board meet at regular intervals and plan for Christian nurture and 
  outreach among the Wa people of the region. Pastor John is a founding member 
  of the WCF and currently serves as secretary. He also pastors the only Wa church 
  in the greater Chiang Mai area -- it meets in the Lawa Student Hostel bamboo 
  chapel</span><br>
</p>
<h4><span class="bodyCopy">4. Briefly describe the project (include name of the 
  people or ethnic group among whom the mission is being carried out):</span></h4>
<p><span class="bodyCopy"> 1) Lawa Student Hostel - The Hostel is in Chiang Mai, 
  Thailand, with 34 students, grades 1-12, two house parents - direct Presbyterian 
  Church (USA) support – and Rev. John Saniex and his wife who provide spiritual 
  guidance and leadership to the children. Thanks to Community Presbyterian Church, 
  Vacaville, CA, for the salaries and ministry of Wa pastor/evangelist John, which 
  are accounted for by Allan Eubank. For 2006, they have been included in this 
  integrated report on Christian outreach among the ethnic Wa people-group. Thanks 
  also to the supporters of the Thai Christian Foundation who help make possible 
  this and other projects in Thailand. Once again, we express deep appreciation 
  to you at Covenant Presbyterian Church of Huntsville, Alabama, and Mrs. Adele 
  Anderson for the Hostel truck. It is on its sixth year and takes the children 
  to school every day, hauls groceries and school supplies as well as transporting 
  the Lawa children on their church visitations and evangelistic missions during 
  school breaks.<br>
  </span> </p>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  2) Evangelists – There are 8 evangelists/teachers working full time in the Wa 
  State that we support, 2 indirectly and 6 directly. One of them, Sam Lao, is 
  a graduate of Payao Bible School (supported there by your funds) and is working 
  for the fifth year as an evangelist and pastor. One full-time Wa evangelist 
  travels the Thai side of the border and shares the gospel with the Lawa people. 
  There are six evangelist/teachers in the Northern Wa State, four based out of 
  the Ying Phang hostel and two at Cao Tie, the old hostel site. One part-time 
  evangelist/pastor travels to both sides of the border and also on Wa evangelistic 
  trips to Northern Wa State.<p>
  <p>
  3) Evangelism trips – Wa pastor/evangelists are engaged in teaching and preaching 
  at various Christian villages in Wa State and in southern Shan State. There 
  are Lawa Student Hostel trips to border areas within Thailand for evangelism, 
  as well as regular travel by Thai Wa pastor/evangelists to Wa villages in Thailand 
  and Burma border areas.<p>
  <p>
  4) Christian literature – Distribution of materials in Wa language is ongoing, 
  such as New Testaments, Genesis & Psalms, Wa hymnals and the booklet, “How to 
  be a Christian.”<p>
  <p>
  5) Northern Wa State Hostel and School – 23 poor Wa children at Ying Phang in 
  Northern Wa State. Some have lost one or both parents and some are from poverty-stricken 
  families. At least 25 more children attend the school during the day. The hostel 
  is on its fifth year through the grace of God. We have been able to provide 
  support for 3 months of the year and have depended on the Wa church for the 
  balance.<p>
  <p>
  6) Medical care – In the past, we have helped to provide medical care for Wa 
  people. This year, the need for malaria prevention measures led us to help the 
  WCF send 200 mosquito nets to Wa families in southern Shan State.<br>
  </span>
<p>&nbsp;
<h4><span class="bodyCopy"> 5. Major activities of the past 12 months:</span> 
</h4>
<p><span class="bodyCopy"> 1) The Lawa Student Hostel in Chiang Mai northern Thailand, 
  is thriving with 34 young people in residence who come to Chiang Mai from villages 
  and towns in northern Thailand for a good public education and Christian nurture 
  in a Wa language environment. We pray that in the future they will become Christian 
  leaders who will reach out with the good news of Jesus Christ across borders 
  and issues dividing Wa and other ethnic peoples in the Burma-China-Thailand 
  region.<p>
  If you come to Chiang Mai, be sure to stop by and meet the students and hostel 
  parents and Rev. John Saniex and his wife, Sopha. It’s thrilling to join the 
  young people in worship at vespers any evening of the week or at the weekly 
  Wa language church service on Sunday afternoon. In this place it is clear that 
  Christ is Lord of the nations.<br>
  </span> 
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  2) The Wa outreach project is more about “building lives” than building facilities—but 
  a permanent facility is a part of the process. The month of March 2007 marks 
  the end of three years in bamboo dormitories. After much prayer, a Hostel Construction 
  Committee has been formed to oversee construction. A contractor was selected 
  and in February 2007 the contract was signed. Funding is coming in, but please 
  pray with us for God’s grace and provision for the 34 hostel students at this 
  crucial time.<br>
  </span>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  3) A Lawa Hostel Committee was formed and met for the first time on Nov. 4, 
  2006. Our plan is to broaden the hostel’s base in the community. The Committee 
  is made up of Rev. John Saniex, the house father, several Lawa and Thai pastors 
  and elders from neighboring churches, a district church leader, Payap University 
  vice president for finance as well as Allan Eubank and Kay Orsini, volunteer 
  coordinator.<br>
  </span>
<p> 
<p><span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  4) Rev. Joshua (Yawsu), Wa elder from Burma:</span><span class="caption"> </span></p>
<span class="bodyCopy">
<p> In 2006, WCF pastors met a number of times with their Wa counterparts from 
  Burma in the Thai border town of Mae Sai to work on Bible translation and Wa 
  evangelism training. Rev. Joshua (Yawsu) Chin, a sprightly 97 year old Wa Christian 
  elder from Lashio in northeastern Burma traveled with his daughter and several 
  church leaders to one of these Mae Sai meetings. He had helped Rev. Vincent 
  Young put spoken Wa into written form back during 1928 to 1930. From1932 to 
  1937, he helped translate the New Testament into Wa. Vincent was the son of 
  William Marcus Young, the first missionary to the Wa.<br>
</span> 
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  As Rev. Joshua spoke about his memories of those early days, his eyes shone 
  and his lean brown face creased in smile lines. He told how Rev. William Marcus 
  Young had blessed him at three significant times in his life. He was born, he 
  said, on October 17, 1910. His Christian Lahu mother had taken him as a month-old 
  baby to William Marcus Young in Keng Tung to dedicate him to the Lord’s work 
  (his father was Wa). She asked Rev. Young to bless the baby and give him a name. 
  He opened the Bible, turned some pages and christened him Joshua (Yawsu). <p>
  At the age of 15, Rev. Young had baptized him. And when Joshua was 20, he had 
  blessed him as he graduated from Banna Bible College at the American Baptist 
  Mission (ABM) in Yunnan. Rev. Young had moved his family and his mission there, 
  and young Joshua’s family had followed.<br>
  </span>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  Rev. Joshua is alert and talkative and acts more like a man in his seventies 
  than one in his late nineties. He answered many questions through an interpreter 
  with vigor and intelligence. He said his life verse is Joshua 24:15 which concludes 
  with the words, “But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.” Later 
  after the meeting, I asked him the secret of long life. Without hesitation he 
  answered, “My life is long by the grace of God.” Then he broke into a song in 
  English, “Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jesus.” Pastor Solomon, Lawa preacher 
  at Chiang Saen, was interpreting. He talked about how Rev. Joshua has always 
  spent a part of each day walking and stopping to visit people and discuss the 
  good news of Jesus Christ. He is fluent in Wa, Shan, Burmese, Chinese, and Lahu. 
  He is known wherever Wa people live and in Lahu and Shan territory as well. 
  He is the elder that Wa Christians most respect and revere.<br>
  </span>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  Allan Eubank was not able to be at that particular meeting, but sent his greetings 
  to Rev. Joshua. I passed them along and said how much Allan loved and respected 
  him and how glad he was that God had used Rev. Joshua for the spread of the 
  gospel all these years. Allan had recalled how they had walked together through 
  Wa territory back in 1995. It seems to me that the friendship they share only 
  Jesus Christ could have built—it’s a bridge that spans vastly different cultures 
  and the passage of time. We thank God for the hearts of these two men who continue 
  to love and serve Him – apart, but together in the family of God.<br>
  </span>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  5) Wa Old Testament:<p>
  The first translation and revision of the Wa Old Testament have been completed 
  since the year 2000, however there has not been complete agreement on certain 
  spelling and interpretations. There are 18 different dialects of Wa, and a few 
  years ago there were significant revisions to standard written Wa. In late 2005, 
  Mark Young (missionary to the Wa) and a Wa Pastor printed 7,000 copies of the 
  Wa Old Testament for distribution some of which have been distributed among 
  Wa churches in southern Shan State. <br>
  </span>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  From Feb. 1 to July 31, 2006 an Old Testament “workshop” of 8 Wa pastors from 
  Burma, China and Thailand met regularly in the Thai border town of Mae Sai to 
  review the Wa translation. For those from Burma, a 6-day pass to Thailand was 
  arranged after which time they would cross the border and then return on the 
  following day for 6 more days. This Old Testament revision is what the WCF and 
  the Provincial Wa State Baptist Association (Mong Mao) wish to publish with 
  the New Testament and give for distribution during Wa Jubilee (100th anniversary) 
  celebrations in March 2008. At that time, Wa State will celebrate the first 
  Wa baptism in 1908.<br>
  </span>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  6) Mae Sai Evangelism Center:<br>
  In the fall of 2006, several of the pastors at the Mae Sai Center provided evangelism 
  training for a group of 11 Wa trainees, nine from Burma and two from Thailand. 
  They taught the young people how to teach written Wa to others who would then 
  be able to read the Bible in their own language. This cross-border workshop 
  could evolve into a permanent Wa Christian training center.<br>
  </span>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  7) Ying Phang Hostel in Northern Wa State:<br>
  Ying Phang Hostel in Northern Wa State houses 23 children in an environment 
  of Christian nurture. About 50 children study at the school. The hostel teachers 
  and children are bright lights of faith in Wa State. In 2006, Dr. Thein Lwin, 
  a former Burmese dissident with a PhD in Education from England, raised funds 
  to build a permanent dormitory of brick and plaster at Ying Phang. Based in 
  Chiang Mai, he works in educational training for Burmese ethnic groups along 
  the Thailand-Burma border. He speaks of forgiveness when relating his experiences 
  of being imprisoned and beaten during the late 1980s and early 1990s. <br>
  </span> 
<p> 
<span class="bodyCopy"><br>
The food supply for at Ying Phang hostel is still not secure, but a UN friend 
is working on rice deliveries through the UN World Food Program school feeding 
program—some of which the hostel received last year from July to November. We 
hope to know soon what the hostel can depend on from the UN and then will get 
the word out about their remaining needs. The same UN individual may also be able 
to get technical assistance to help the hostel build a fish pond to increase their 
ability to raise their own food. Please join us in prayer for these children in 
Wa State. Thank you.
<p> 
<p> 8) Evangelism in Wa State:
<p> The six full-time evangelist/teachers stationed in Northern Wa State, Burma, 
  continue their work sharing the gospel, strengthening believers and teaching. 
  Again in 2006, limitations were put on their village evangelistic work by Wa 
  State authorities. Therefore they focused their efforts on spiritual nurture 
  of the hostel and school children knowing that the children’s faith will help 
  lead their families to the Lord. The Ying Phang evangelists pray that when they 
  complete their education, they will be able to nurture others and become bridges 
  for their people to live better lives through Christ. 

<h4 class="bodyCopy"> 6. Changes in personnel, short-term objectives or emphases 
  since beginning of the project or last report:</h4>
<p> 1) The Lawa Christian Hostel in Chiang Mai is a wonderfully vital place and 
  is under the cooperative ownership of the Wa Christian Fellowship. The number 
  of students has grown from 23 in 2004 to 34 in 2006. See paragraph 5.4 above 
  for our plans and prayers for a permanent structure. The Hostel celebrated the 
  Christmas season in a big way this year with a community-wide Christmas party 
  for 300 people. We had worship, Lawa and Thai singing and dancing, buffet lunch, 
  gifts for adults and children and games for the kids. The party was an outreach 
  to share the true meaning of Christmas, and it fostered neighborly relations 
  between the hostel and local community.<br>
</span> 
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  In fall 2006, the hostel students began using the wonderful computers and household 
  equipment (bunk beds, etc) that Rotary International donated in cooperation 
  with Walla Walla, Washington, and Chiang Mai Rotary Clubs. We are in need of 
  volunteers to help teach basic computer skills and English to the students. 
  Thanks to another Rotary International grant with Tempe Arizona and Chiang Mai 
  Rotary Clubs, the deep well and water tower project to upgrade the hostel water 
  supply was completed this year.<br>
  </span>
<p> <span class="bodyCopy"><br>
  2) The WCF invited youth leaders to form a Lawa Youth Council last Fall. More 
  than 30 young people aged upper high school to twenty-something participated 
  in the first meeting December16 at a Wa church in Chiang Rai. Rev. John Saniex’s 
  daughter, Ruth, and a student from the Chiang Mai hostel were elected secretary 
  and treasurer. The Lawa Youth hope to develop leadership skills, to mentor the 
  younger members and to lead the Lawa (Wa) community into the future. Please 
  pray with us that they catch a vision for helping their Wa brothers and sisters 
  in the region (Burma, China and Thailand).<br>
  </span>
<p> 
<span class="bodyCopy"><br>
3) For Christian workers in Wa State, Burma, building up new believers, baptism 
and unity efforts are their main activities. Many times they must continue forward 
on a wing and a prayer from fellow believers around the world because of strong 
local opposition to their work.
<p> 
<p> 4) Kay Orsini, volunteer Wa coordinator from San Diego California, joined 
  the Wa support team here in Chiang Mai in October 2005 and can be seen at the 
  hostel teaching English and computer skills, as well as English at the neighborhood 
  primary school around the corner from the hostel. She also helps with administrative 
  work. She is seeking overseas volunteers to help the hostel students develop 
  their computer and English skills when she leaves for the U.S. sometime in the 
  next 12 months. No computer technicians are required, just ordinary people who 
  use home computers.
