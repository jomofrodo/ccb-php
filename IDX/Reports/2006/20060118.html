  <p><b><span class="bodyCopy">18 January, 2006</span></b>
  <p> <span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy">Dear friends, </span></span>
  <p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy">Thanks for all your prayers 
    and help. We are in the middle of a relief mission and wanted to pass this 
    short story on to you. The lady in the photo is named Naw Rutha, she gave 
    birth to a baby boy in the first week of December. One week later the Burma 
    Army came to attack and she and the other villagers fled. She is now back 
    at her village (the village is really only simple shelters as it has been 
    burned many times before). She is sick with high blood pressure and a heart 
    problem but still smiles. One of our medics treated her the best we could 
    and she invited us to stay in her home. She wants to stay in her homeland 
    and be safe from the attacks of the Burma Army. Now she can not have both, 
    but in spite of the danger she and her husband choose to stay. </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> We prayed with her and then 
    continued on the mission. Thanks for helping us do that and thank you for 
    your prayers for people like this mother. </span></span>
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> God bless you, FBR </span></span>

                a network of indigenous field teams, FBR is able to carry out 
                research into human rights abuses, casualties and humanitarian 
                needs of people too often forgotten by the outside world. FBR 
                provides medical, spiritual and educational resources for IDP 
                communities as they struggle to survive Burmese military attacks.
