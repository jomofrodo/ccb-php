  Volunteer Coordinator <br>

  P.O. Box 14, Mae Jo Chiang Mai 50290 THAILAND </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="title2"> Introduction: </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> Dear Friends of the Wa, Thank 

  you so much to all of you who care for the Wa and have helped so generously. 

  We thank God too for Kay Orsini who is the new volunteer coordinator for the 

  Wa work here. She is a blessing to us and helps by running the administrative 

  side of this work and most importantly, by sharing her life and faith with the 

  Wa people. See two photos about the Wa outreach attached below and additional 

  photos sent with a second email. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> I (David), spend most of my 

  time now on foot, on relief missions with the Karen, Karenni and Shan displaced 

  people. (You will receive also our Eubank family letter about this past year, 

  2005). Because of the Wa partnership with the Burma dictators in legitimate 

  business as well as narcotic production and trafficking, we have not been able 

  to go to the Wa State since 2000. The Burma Army and Wa have a cease fire agreement 

  that makes it difficult to work in the Wa state due to Burma Army oversight. 

  So we support the Wa pastors and then go where we can, (that is into the other 

  ethnic areas where the Burma Army is conducting attacks against the Karen, Karenni 

  and Shan people. It is a Burma Army policy of shoot on sight but we can move 

  with the ethnics who can usually avoid the Burma Army). When I am in Thailand 

  we meet with the Wa Christian Fellowship to pray, assess the work, make plans 

  and encourage each other. The mission to the Wa continues despite obstacles. 

  </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> Narcotics, collusion with the 

  dictators, and attacks on other ethnic groups make the Wa an easy scapegoat. 

  However the Wa people themselves have very little choice and are but pawns in 

  a deadly game. Animism continues to grip the people, and the threat of attack 

  by the Army of Burma’s dictators means that most Wa live in uncertainty and 

  fear. In spite of this, the church shines its light of God’s love and freedom. 

  And in spite of many obstacles, the church continues to grow. Thank you for 

  your part in that growth. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> <span class="bodyTitle">4. Briefly 

  describe the project</span> (include name of the people or ethnic group among 

  whom the mission being carried out): 1) Lawa Student Hostel outside Chiang Mai, 

  Thailand, with 34 students, grades 1-12, two house parents - direct Presbyterian 

  Church (USA) support – and Pastor John Saniex and his wife who provide spiritual 

  guidance and leadership to the children. Thanks to Community Presbyterian Church, 

  Vacaville, CA, for the salaries and ministry of Wa Pastor/Evangelist John, which 

  are accounted for by Allan Eubank. For 2005, they have been included in this 

  integrated report on Christian outreach among the ethnic Wa people-group. Thanks 

  also to the supporters of the Thai Christian Foundation who help make possible 

  this and other projects in Thailand. Once again, we express deep appreciation 

  to you at Covenant Presbyterian Church of Huntsville, AL and Mrs. Adele Anderson 

  for the truck for the Hostel. It is on its fifth year and takes the children 

  to school every day, hauls groceries and school supplies as well as transporting 

  the Wa children on their evangelistic missions during school breaks. </span></span> 

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> Note 1: Lawa is the name used 

  for the ethnic Wa in Thailand, but Wa is the name of the language and of the 

  people-group elsewhere in the region (Burma and China). There are an estimated 

  one million Wa people in Burma; 200,000 in China; and 100,000 in Thailand. Note 

  2: The Wa Christian Fellowship (WCF) is part of the 18th District of the Church 

  of Christ Thailand (CCT). The Wa pastors on the WCF Board meet at regular intervals 

  and plan for Christian nurture and outreach among the Wa people of the region. 

  Pastor John is a founding member of the WCF and currently serves as secretary. 

  He also pastors the only Wa church in the greater Chiang Mai area -- it meets 

  in the Hostel bamboo chapel. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 2) Evangelists – There are 8 

  evangelists/teachers working full time in the Wa State that we support, 2 indirectly 

  and 6 directly. One full-time evangelist in North Central Wa State (Sam Lao) 

  is a graduate of Payao Bible School (supported there by your funds) and is working 

  for the fifth year full-time as an evangelist and pastor. One full-time Wa Evangelist 

  travels the Thai-Burma border and shares the gospel with the Wa people. Six 

  evangelist/teachers in the Northern Wa State. There are 3 evangelist/teachers 

  in the Southern Wa State (supported by Pastor Joseph). One part-time evangelist/pastor 

  travels to both sides of the border. Also Wa evangelistic trips to Northern 

  Wa State. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 3) Evangelism trips – Wa pastor/evangelists 

  are engaged in teaching and preaching at various Christian villages in Wa State 

  and in southern Shan State. There are Lawa Student Hostel trips to border areas 

  within Thailand for evangelism, as well as regular travel by Thai Wa pastor/evangelists 

  to Wa villages in Thailand and Burma border areas. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 4) Distribution of Christian 

  literature in the Wa language is ongoing, such as New Testaments, Genesis & 

  Psalms, Wa hymnals and the booklet, “How to be a Christian.” </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 5) Northern Wa State Hostel 

  and School – 23 poor Wa children at Ying Pang in Northern Wa State. Some have 

  lost one or both parents and some are from poverty-stricken families. An additional 

  25 children attend the school during the day. The hostel is on its fifth year 

  through the grace of God. We have been able to provide support for 3 months 

  of the year and have depended on the Wa church for the balance. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 6) Medical care for Wa – We 

  have helped to provide medical care for two Wa people. One man did not respond 

  to medical help but was healed later through prayer. Two Wa pastors, John and 

  Joseph, both laid hands on him and read James Chapter 5:14-16. Pastor John asked 

  the sick man, “Do you believe?” The man said, “Yes.” They read the verses and 

  prayed. Later when they came back to see him, they were told that he was out 

  visiting friends, because he had recovered from the illness. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> <span class="bodyTitle">5. Major 

  Activities of the past 12 months</span>: 1) Oct 28 – Nov 7, 2005, two Wa pastor/evangelists 

  (Pastors John and Solomon) traveled from Chiang Mai to Chiang Saen, at the northern 

  border of Thailand, then up the Mekong River and across Wa State in Burma to 

  Chang Yuan, China. They were sent by the Wa Christian Fellowship (WCF) in Thailand 

  to meet with Wa Christian leaders who came over from Burma. At the meeting plans 

  were made for the 2008 celebration of 100 years of Christian faith among the 

  Wa people. They discussed the best use of land given to Christians near Muang 

  Mao by the Wa State Government to help those crippled during war with the Communists, 

  as well as the aged and orphans. They also discussed ways that missionary help 

  could be channeled into Wa State through an office to be established in Mae 

  Sai, Thailand. At the meeting was a Wa Christian lawyer who had been selected 

  by the United Wa State Army (UWSA) as their representative to the Burmese dictatorship. 

  Recently, the Wa pastors have increased their coordination with such lay leaders 

  in order to be better informed of current events in various areas of Wa State, 

  including opportunities that may open up for more direct and open evangelism. 

  The two pastors also met with Roi Gyi, an evangelist/teacher supported by the 

  WCF who teaches at Ying Pang Hostel in Northern Wa State. From there they traveled 

  on to Shaying, China, Pastor Solomon’s home town, and to Yong Khrao, Pastor 

  John’s home village. Cross-border ties between Wa Christian leaders were strengthened 

  on this trip. </span></span> 

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 2) Dec 18-20, 2005, Pastor John 

  and his wife made a trip to Ban Kang District in southern Shan State to share 

  the gospel and nurture Christians there. The area is near the Thai-Burma border, 

  northwest of Mae Sai, Thailand. 700 Christian families were forced by the Wa 

  State Army to move into that area two to three years ago and they are without 

  spiritual leadership of any kind. The Wa Christian Fellowship is praying for 

  a full-time Wa pastor for this station. Before leaving Tachilek on the Burma 

  side of the border, they met with a Wa Christian leader who was formerly a member 

  of the Wa State Central Committee, but now is semi-retired doing trading and 

  farming. He is concerned about the future of his people and has the same vision 

  to ask God to call a dedicated pastor to serve the Ban Kang area. Please pray 

  for the right person and for support. Pastor John and he presented a microscope 

  that had been donated by a Singapore Christian for malaria diagnosis to a local 

  hospital. The Thai Government had built the hospital a few years ago to help 

  the people in the area who were so involved in drug trafficking. On arrival 

  in Ban Kang District, Pastor John and his wife participated in the dedication 

  of a new church at Yoang Maw, a village of 66 Christian families. They went 

  on to a Christmas celebration at Na Yao village where 80 Christian families 

  live. Another village with 120 Christian families is within walking distance. 

  A single spigot is the only water source for three villages in that area. They 

  are requesting help to build a cement water storage tank, and we are praying 

  to the Lord for these funds. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 3) Ying Pang Hostel in Northern 

  Wa State houses 23 children in an environment of Christian nurture. 48 children 

  study at the school. The hostel teachers and children are bright lights of faith 

  in Wa State. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 4) The Lawa Student Hostel in 

  Chiang Mai, Thailand, is thriving with 34 young people in residence who come 

  to Chiang Mai for public education and Christian nurture. They attend first 

  through twelfth grades. With the generous gifts and hard work of many, land 

  was purchased for the Wa Christian Fellowship. Students moved out of rented 

  quarters in mid-2004 and into the facility which includes two temporary bamboo 

  dormitories, a bamboo church and one small, permanent structure for an office 

  and hostel parents’ quarters. Since that time, due to the permeable nature of 

  the bamboo walls, a volunteer architect has drawn plans for a two-story structure 

  including dormitory for 50 students and a multi-purpose space on the ground 

  floor. Please pray with us for God’s will to be done regarding this project. 

  And if any of you come to Chiang Mai, be sure stop by to meet the students and 

  hostel parents. It’s thrilling to join these young people in worship at vespers 

  any evening of the week or at the weekly Wa church service any Sunday afternoon. 

  Here it is so clear that Christ is the Lord of the nations. Hostel students 

  went out as a team on evangelism trips to various areas of northern Thailand 

  again in 2005, including one to Chiang Rai during Songkran, the big Buddhist 

  celebration of traditional New Year in April. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 5) Evangelism in Wa State: The 

  six full-time evangelist/teachers stationed in Northern Wa State, Burma, continue 

  their work sharing the gospel, strengthening believers and teaching. However, 

  the fact is that during 2005, many limitations were put on their village evangelistic 

  work by the Wa State authorities. They had to shift their focus to spiritual 

  nurture of the hostel children in the hope that their faith would lead their 

  families to the Lord. Once the children finish fourth grade at the hostel, it 

  is possible for them to continue at one of the other Christian Hostels in Burma, 

  like May Myo (of the Kachin Baptist Convention), Mandalay or Rangoon. Three 

  of the children have continued their education at the May Myo Hostel in recent 

  years. The Ying Pang evangelists’ vision is that when these Wa young people 

  complete their education, they will become bridges for their people to move 

  forward in the world. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 6) Wa Old Testament: The first 

  translation and first revision of the Old Testament have been completed since 

  the year 2000, however there has been disagreement on certain spelling and interpretations. 

  There are 18 different dialects of Wa, and a few years ago there were significant 

  revisions to the standard written Wa. This year, Mark Young (missionary to the 

  Wa in northern Thailand) and Wa Pastor Samrong printed 7,000 copies of the Wa 

  Old Testament for distribution. Since Feb. 1, 2006 a Wa Old Testament “workshop” 

  of 8 Wa pastors from around the region has been meeting regularly in Mae Sai 

  to review the year 2000 translation. A missionary group from Taiwan is funding 

  this revision. Representing the Wa in China is Pastor Sai Khwat. From Wa State 

  is Rev. Ai Mhawm, from Keng Tung is Rev. Marku and from Lashio, Burma, is Rev. 

  Ngao Saik (an energetic pastor of the younger generation). The Wa in Thailand 

  are represented by Rev. Joseph, Pastor Solomon, Pastor Ai Kat from Fang and 

  Rev. John Saniex from Chiang Mai. Their goal is to complete the revision by 

  this October. Keep them in your prayers. They also see an opportunity for this 

  cross-border “workshop” to evolve into a permanent regional Wa Christian Center 

  at Mae Sai for training, communications and development for the Wa people. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> <span class="bodyTitle">6. Changes 

  in personnel, short-term objectives or emphases since beginning of the project 

  or last report:</span> 1) The Lawa Christian Hostel in Chiang Mai is a wonderfully 

  vital place and is under the cooperative ownership of the Wa Christian Fellowship. 

  The number of students has grown from 23 in 2004 to 34 in 2005. See paragraph 

  5.4 above for our plans and prayers for a permanent structure. Christmas Day 

  at the Hostel was a delightful experience of worship and fellowship with students 

  and Wa church adult members, music, a Christmas skit by the students as well 

  as a delicious meal. A lively soccer match on the hostel green concluded the 

  celebration. The students recently helped stuff more than 2,500 envelopes with 

  pamphlets for the Global Day of Prayer for Burma which the Free Burma Rangers 

  (FBR/CCB) are sending to Christian churches all over Thailand. (March 12th is 

  the Global Day of Prayer for Burma). </span></span> 

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 2) Kay Orsini, the volunteer 

  coordinator, a retiree from San Diego California, joined the Wa support team 

  here in Chiang Mai last October and can be seen at the hostel and teaching English 

  at the neighborhood primary school around the corner from the hostel (or doing 

  correspondence and helping write reports like this one). </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 3) Baux Sang, the recently trained 

  woman from the Kachin tribe is continuing to work as one of the evangelist/teachers 

  out of Ying Pang </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 4) Building up new believers, 

  baptism and unity efforts are the main activities of the Christian workers in 

  the Wa State. Many times they must continue their work on a wing and on the 

  prayers of fellow believers from around the world because of strong opposition 

  to their work. Some good news about evangelism arrived in just the last few 

  weeks: a new Wa commander in the Muang Yawn area of the southern Wa State is 

  much friendlier towards Christian work. He called to invite Christians to become 

  involved again in his area of command. The previous commander was anti-Christian 

  destroying the churches and burning the Bibles. There are about 1,000 Christian 

  families in the area. We are hoping this change in the government means that 

  a door has opened to do more evangelistic work in the Muang Yawn area. </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 5) Outreach to people inside 

  Thailand: Pastor John visits various Wa churches in the border area for Christian 

  nurture every month and goes to Mae Sai for WCF and other Wa church meetings 

  regularly. The Moderator and the General Secretary of the Church of Christ Thailand 

  met with the l8th District and Wa Christian leaders on a border visit in 2005. 

  Hostel students went on evangelism trips to Mae Poon Lang, Huay Maw, and Nawng 

  Khyo as well as to Chiang Rai during Songkran (paragraph 5.4 above). </span></span>

<p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> 6) Three Wa Church leaders, 

  Pastor Banjong and Nai John from Nawng Khyo (minister and church moderator respectively) 

  and Pastor John Saniex, participated in a multi-ethnic communications workshop 

  set up by the Free Burma Rangers (FBR) and supported by Voice of Peace, a Chiang 

  Mai-based communications media ministry. Unity work and communication between 

  ethnic groups is key to the future of peace in Burma. </span></span>
