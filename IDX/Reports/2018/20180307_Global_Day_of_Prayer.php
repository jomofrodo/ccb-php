<p>Dear praying friends,
Thank you for how you pray
with faith and love. This past
year the people of Burma have
suffered many injustices: the
murder, rape, and burning of
villages and displacement of
over 600,000 Rohingya people,
the ongoing attacks against the
Kachin, Ta’ang and northern
Shan, the encroachment of the
Burma military in ceasefire
areas and the lack of care by the
government for people who have
been wronged.
<p>
During this time indigenous
relief teams have responded
in love and with help as best
they can. We see relief teams
bringing life-saving care to the
displaced, pastors comforting
their people and praying for
justice and love, new medics and
teachers being trained in the
jungle to help their people, and
the international community
sounding the alarm for help
for the oppressed. All these are
answers to prayer in the face of
evil.
<p>
In some ways Burma has
improved. There is a civilian elected
government and more
freedoms in some areas, but
the military holds ultimate
power and uses it. We pray for
the military to have a change
of heart and for the elected
government to have the
courage to stand for all who are
oppressed.
<p>
In the midst of this some from
Burma have also been called to
help in Iraq and Syria because
of ISIS attacks there. How did
people from Burma get to the
Middle East and what does it
have to do with Burma? We
were invited because people
knew we could help in war
zones and we went because we
believe God has no boundaries
to helping each other.

<p>In the bloody crucible
of Mosul, Iraq, my family,
volunteers, and some of our
senior FBR ethnics from Burma
learned lessons that we want to
share in Burma and everywhere.
These are not new lessons but
they were burned into us by
the desperate situations we
saw, our dependency on God,
and the spiritual battle we saw
overarching the physical battle.

<p>In the midst of this God showed
us four things.

<p>First, wherever Jesus sends
you, He goes with you. So when
we are afraid we can pray and
ask, "Jesus is this really your
will?" Then if it is still a 'yes', go
boldly in His name and use His
name to overcome evil.

<p>Second, when faced with great
evil, we sinful humans cannot
defeat it. But if we are following
Jesus and call on His name, He
comes through our weakness
and brings good out of the
clutches of evil.


<p>Third, what is the difference
between justice and vengeance?
I believe vengeance is an
attempt to get justice with a
spirit of hate and retribution.
When you suffer injustice, the
hurt can cause you to hate the
perpetrator and to equate their
hurt with justice – but hate will
cripple you if you search for
justice this way, and justice will
elude you. Justice can only be
achieved with love and mercy.
This means when you are
wronged you pray for love for
the perpetrator and you seek
justice in that love. We need
God’s help to love those who
wrong us, to love our enemies
– but when we pray and ask for
this love He helps us. This may
mean punishment for the person
who wronged you but it will
be done in a spirit of love. This
spirit keeps us free and leads
towards reconciliation.

<p>Four, we experienced the
power of the praying church
and believe that God’s power
through prayer is the only way
to achieve freedom, justice,
reconciliation and love.
In Burma as in other places
there is hate, murder, and all
manner of injustice. The way
forward is to pray and ask Jesus
to help us love and help us know
where to go, how to go and what
to do. And then wherever He
sends us, Jesus goes with us, so
we can go humbly, boldly and in
His love.

<p>Thank you for praying with us
for all the people of Burma. God
bless you.
