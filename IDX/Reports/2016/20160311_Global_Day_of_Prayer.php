<p>Dear Friends, 

<p>This year's Global Day of Prayer for Burma is this Sunday, March 13th. Join us as people around the world gather to pray for the nation of Burma, for freedom from oppression for people of all faiths and ethnicities, for guidance for the leaders of Burma, for justice and reconciliation, and that the hearts of all would be turned to love. 

<p>We have made a prayer guide that is available on our website and there is a link to it below. Thank you for praying with us. 

<p>God bless you,

<p>Christians Concerned for Burma

<p>
