<h1>Message from a Nurse:</h1>
<h3>15 Octobler, 2007</h3>
<p><i><span class="greytext">Dear friends , </span></i></p>
<p><span class="greytext"><i>This is from a nurse, Cindy, who helped us train 
  new Shan medics in a border area last month. I hope her message is an encouragement 
  to you,</i> </span>
<p><span class="greytext"><i>God bless you, the FBR team</i> </span>
<hr>
<p>One of my favorite old English carols has a verse that goes like this:
<p><i>What can I give Him, poor as I am?<br>
  If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;<br>
  If I were a wise man, I would do my part;<br>
  But what I can, I give Him—give Him my heart. </i>
<p><br>
  I feel like I gave my body, heart, and soul to be able to go to visit Shan internally 
  displaced persons (IDPs) on the border. The Free Burma Rangers (FBR), a humanitarian 
  releif organization that works in the conflict areas of Burma and Partners Relief 
  and Development were conducting a joint training of Shan FBR releif teams. I 
  was invited to participate. I began getting in shape for this trip over 9 months 
  ago. Not exactly easy when you're 54 years old and have never done regular aerobic 
  exercise. By June, I progressed to hiking the 11 km. road up the mountain near 
  my home every Saturday. With each plodding step I prayed for the people of Burma 
  and for my poor, struggling body (sometimes in reverse order). In August and 
  September, when I left the "easy" road hikes to begin doing the jungle trail 
  up the same mountain once or twice every week, I thought about my physical agony 
  with each panting breath and mentally labored to keep my focus on the goal of 
  passing the physical endurance requirements set by Partners.
<p>&nbsp;

<p>In mid-September, I along with others walked into the training site. That is 
  when I met this woman and the baby. The woman had been invited by the FBR to 
  share her story. When the baby smiled at me, two small teeth gleamed in the 
  sunshine. When the woman smiled, one solitary tooth stood like a lone sentinel 
  at the left corner of her mouth.
<p><br>
  Teeth. One good way to do a quick assessment among the IDPs of Burma is to count 
  teeth. Many, by the time they are 30 or 40 years old, have less teeth than the 
  fingers on one hand. Counting teeth is like receiving a full report in 2 seconds 
  about poverty, malnutrition, lack of education and dental hygiene, and lack 
  of access to health care.
<p>But though this woman tried to smile with her mouth closed to hide her toothlessness, 
  her lone tooth had spoken to me.
<p><i>What can I give…poor as I am?</i> 
<p>My answer: I'm giving a lot, Lord. Look at all I did to get here: All those 
  preparatory hikes. All that time exercising in between. All the expenses: good 
  hiking shoes, energy bars, clothes made of fast-drying fabric. And don't forget 
  that hike to get here! And now, I'm still giving: giving up electricity, a warm 
  shower, a soft mattress. 
<p><i>What can I give…poor as I am?</i>
<p><br>
  This woman's answer:<i> I'll give this baby my love and a place in my home and 
  my heart.</i>
<p><br>
  Raped and impregnated by an escaped Burma army soldier, the baby's mother died 
  from "complications" 10 days after giving birth. But here is this 45-year-old 
  poor, toothless woman with three children ages 8-13. She certainly has enough 
  to worry about. Living on a meager food supply without a steady income in an 
  IDP camp under the noses of the hate-filled Burma Army—does it make any sense 
  to take in one more mouth to feed? She is not a relative. She is under no obligation. 
  Yet those chubby baby cheeks just begging to be kissed declare, "Look how much 
  she care about me! I'm well-fed; I'm clean; I'm loved."
<p><br>
  So in a few months, when I again sing this Christmas carol, I'll be thinking 
  about this woman and all that she gives. But I'll be thinking one more thing: 
  that this woman, this baby, the thousands of IDPs in Burma, the thousands of 
  women and girls who have been raped by a single soldier or a gang of soldiers, 
  may someday sing with me,
<p><br>
  <i>What can I give HIM, poor as I am?</i>
<p><br>
  And together we will sing the answer:
<p><i>What I can, I give Him…Give Him my heart!</i>
<p><br>
  I want all the ethnic peoples of Burma to know Jesus, to give their hearts to 
  Jesus! And I will continue to do my part to show Christ's love to them and pray 
  that they will see Him in ME!
<p><br>
  May God bless Partners and the Free Burma Rangers as they bring hope, relief, 
  training, and the Good News!
