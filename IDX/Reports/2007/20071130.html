Friends, </span> 
<p><span class="greytext">We wanted to share this letter with you. It is by a 
  good friend from Partners Relief and Development, who help us in many ways including 
  the training of the Good Life Club counselors that are on each Free Burma Ranger 
  team. We are grateful for their help and encouraged by their love. God bless 
  you, Dave</span>
<h1>Good Life Club Training</h1>
<h3> by Oddny, Partners</h3>
<p>"Yes, I know what that feels like," said Kaw Bla Sei. I was teaching a group 
  of young men and women about trauma and I wasn't really sure if my examples 
  were relevant. "My mother and I were captured by the Burma Army when I was 5 
  years old. For a whole day they dragged us through the jungle without any food 
  and water. Then they let us go. After that happened I was always afraid. It 
  did not go away until I turned 12."
<p>The group I was speaking to were the Good Life Club Counselors. They are the 
  men and women who will focus on the needs of children when they, together with 
  the rest of the relief team they are a part of, enter a village or an IDP site. 
  "Why are the children important?" I ask them every time I start teaching. "Because 
  they are the future!" is the answer I get back. "What is the most important 
  quality you need to serve the children?" "We must love them." Then we spend 
  time talking about how to practically demonstrate this love to the most vulnerable 
  of all: the children of the ethnic groups in Burma. On their journey to the 
  villages and hide sites of the displaced people all over the country, they will 
  assess the children's needs and try to find ways to meet these needs, both the 
  physical and spiritual ones.
<p>I feel humble while I talk to these young men and women, most of them in their 
  early twenties. It's easy for me to stand there on the mud floor with my notes 
  and ideas. The only sacrifice I am making is three weeks away from my kids and 
  my husband, my hot showers and the annoyance of hundreds of mosquito bites. 
  The people I am training are going into a war zone. There are no promises of 
  safety or comfort. They may never be rewarded for their efforts. Hunger, fatigue, 
  sickness and even death may be in store for them. And yet they choose to embrace 
  their calling with enthusiasm and joy.
<p>"This is what I want to do," says Kaw Bla Sei after our session is over. "I 
  really want to help the children of my land." His head is shaven; around his 
  neck he has a string with a tooth on it. I have watched him and the others on 
  his team do their physical exercise in the mornings and the afternoons. His 
  physical strength is the level of a great athlete. Caring for children is not 
  the task I would have chosen for a man like him. "In fact, I have already started 
  helping children," he says proudly, the tooth necklace dangling when he nods 
  his head for emphasis. "A while ago I found four children aged 4 to 10 wandering 
  aimlessly around a village. They did not have any parents. I helped them get 
  to a refugee camp where they were taken in at an orphanage. They are all doing 
  really well now."
<p>He is grateful for the Good Life Club patch that I give him to put on his jacket. 
  "This means you are a qualified GLC counselor," I tell him. "We want this patch 
  to be a symbol that children will start to recognize. When they see the GLC 
  smiley face, they should know that here is a safe person who cares about the 
  children." He holds the patch close to his jacket. He wants us to tell him where 
  we think he should put it. It is not much, but it is a small symbol that lets 
  him know that we trust him and he has been given a job that we consider supremely 
  important.
<p>He has chosen to follow Jesus' calling to serve the little children, and I 
  believe there will be a really special prize for people like him. Until then 
  he will be busy looking for children in need, the Good Life Club patch clearly 
  visible so that all can see it.
