                <h1>Burma: An Urgent Call for Prayer</h1>
                <p>There has been a request from inside Burma urging people of 
                  all faiths to join in a prayer vigil for for the next three 
                  days. Inside Burma they have asked that everyone pray in their 
                  doorways or just outside their houses for 15 minutes at 8 pm 
                  Burma time on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, as sign of solidarity 
                  and an appeal for the restoration of democracy in Burma. 
                <p>For those in the United Sates who would like to join in this, 
                  8pm Burma time is 6:30 am PST time and 9:30 am EST. 
                <p>If you cannot pray at this exact time please try to pray at 
                  anytime that you can. 
                <p>Thank you and God bless you and God Bless the couragous people 
                  of Burma.
