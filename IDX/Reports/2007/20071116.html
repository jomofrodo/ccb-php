<p><span class="greytext">Dear friends, </span> 
<p> 
<p><span class="greytext">Thank you for your love and prayers. We are now training 
  18 new FBR relief teams and I wanted to share this letter with you all. It is 
  written by a good friend who helped to teach leadership to the new teams here. 
  As we train the new teams we ourselves are asking God how to pray and act in 
  the face of the Burma Army attacks. We feel that one of the things we need to 
  do more is to pray for our enemies. We are also preparing for the 2008 Global 
  Day of Prayer for Burma and are thinking about including the message below and 
  making one of our focus points prayer for the dictators and the dictators' army. 
  We would appreciate your prayers and any suggestions you have.<br>
  God bless you, Dave </span>

<h2>Fighting the Serpent by Praying for the Enemy </h2>
<p> 
<p>“The chief and most powerful enemy of human beings is the deceiver of Adam 
  and Eve, the serpent, our ancient foe that “seeks to work us woe.” It wants 
  to destroy the image of God in the world. It wants to damage and destroy our 
  bodies, our minds, our hearts and our souls. 
<p>In this way, even in Burma the Burma Army is not our biggest enemy. Our biggest 
  enemy is the serpent, a symbol of Satan. 
<p>If we forget that our biggest enemy is the serpent, we can forget that God 
  can redeem even the worst commanders and soldiers in the dictator’s military. 
  Many of them are caught in a web of oppression and deceit themselves. A Burma 
  Army general is a human being. He is not the serpent. This can help us pray 
  for even the worst of the soldiers and commanders. We can pray that their eyes 
  be opened to see that God hates hands that shed innocent blood. We can pray 
  that they be released from the power of the serpent and their own bad decisions. 
  We can pray blessing upon them, that the power of bad things in them weakens 
  while the power of good things in them grows. We can pray that they begin to 
  hunger and thirst after righteousness. 
<p>When Jesus tells us to love our enemies and pray for them, this is not a counsel 
  of weakness. It is not a mystery that cannot be understood. If we pray for someone 
  we pray not that they become strong to do evil, but that they become strong 
  to do good. This is just what we want for our enemies, and for the enemies of 
  the people of Burma. We want the power of darkness in these enemies to grow 
  weak. There is no better way to do this than to love those who hate and to pray 
  for them. Love takes away strength from hate, and the power of prayer comes 
  directly against the power of evil. 
<p>We can help the people of Burma by praying for the soldiers that do evil things 
  to them. When we do this we fight against the biggest enemy of us all. When 
  we show love and pray for enemies, we send strong weapons into battle against 
  our ancient foe the serpent. 
<p>Jesus tells us to be wise as serpents, and innocent as doves. If we do not 
  know how to think like serpents, <i>we may get bit by them.</i> If we do not 
  remember to act like doves, <i>we may turn into serpents ourselves</i>. When 
  we pray strategically for the enemies of the innocent, we attack the thinking 
  and activity of the serpent head-on. When we pray for enemies in love, we act 
  with the purity of intention and action of the dove -- the symbol of the Holy 
  Spirit of God.”
