        <h1>80 Hours of Prayer for Burma  </h1>
        <p>Psalm 70- <br>
          <i>For the director of music. Of David. A Petition.</i> 
        <p><i>Hasten, O God, to save me. O Lord, Come quickly to help me. May 
          those who<br>
          seek my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin 
          be<br>
          turned back in disgrace. May those who say to me, 'Aha! Aha!' turn back<br>
          because of their shame. But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad 
          in you;<br>
          may those who love your salvation always say, 'Let God be exalted!' 
          Yet I<br>
          am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my<br>
          deliverer; O Lord do not delay.</i> 
        <p>Christians Concerned for Burma along with Partners Relief & Development 
          is<br>
          hosting an event called &quot;³80 Hours of Prayer for Burma&quot; to

          worship<br>
          together. 
        <p> For all those suffering in Burma, our intention is to commit these 
          80 Hours<br>
          to coming before God in petition, asking him to hasten the end of the
