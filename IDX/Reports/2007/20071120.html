        <p>Dear friends, 
        <p> 
<p>I am sending this letter of thanks from the Karen State where we are training 
  18 new Karen, Karenni and Kachin humanitarian relief teams. With the help of 
  Dr. Mitch and Dr. John, we also just completed the Advanced Medical training 
  for senior medics, and Partners and Oddny trained the new Good Life Club counselors. 
  Finally Dr. Doug and Don helped with leadership and team training.. I am thankful 
  to you all who make this possible, to the Karen people who take care of everything 
  here, to the FBR staff who teach the new teams, to the new team members themselves 
  and most of all to God.
<p> 
<p>As I look around the beautiful jungle valley we are in and see the rushing 
  streams and rising mountains, all the bamboo buildings, the busy staff and enthusiastic 
  students I am filled with gratitude. All of this is a gift from God and those 
  of you who help us in this. I was reminded again that we can not do this alone 
  nor have we ever done anything alone here. This fills me with wonder at God’s 
  provision and the generosity and breadth of vision of people like you all. It 
  also motivates me and the staff here to do our best and live full, free and 
  useful lives that glorify God and honor you all.
<p> 
<p>We will be sending out some of the reflections of the friends above who helped 
  in this training. Their encouragement helped us and we wanted to share this 
  with you. I hope this also might be useful in your lives in some way. 
<p> 
<p>1) God will fight for you. Be strong in the mighty power of God.
<p>2) The rider on the white horse (Rev 19:11-14) will fight for the displaced 
  people.
<p>3) Go deep and go ahead, not broad or shallow or sideways
<p>4) God reveals what lies in darkness.
<p> 
<p>We are reminded and inspired that God cares and takes action in all of our 
  lives. 
<p>Thank you all for your prayers, love and support.
<p>God bless you,
<p>Dave and all of the team here
<p>
