<p>Thousands of Christians began a fast throughout Burma on Wednesday to pray<br>
  for the release of arrested pro-democracy protesters and for peace to<br>
  prevail in Burma.
<p>A local resident in Myitkyina, in upper Burma’s Kachin State, said about<br>
  6,000 people from 57 parishes in the Myitkyina region were participating<br>
  in the fast from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. in various churches. Collections were<br>
  taken for the relief of needy people.
<p>“They pray for a change of mind by the Burmese military leaders,” he said.
<p>Pastors of some churches were reported to have condemned the junta for its<br>
  violent crackdown on dissension.
<p>Other fasts were being held in Bamaw, Lashio, Moekaung, Mohnyin, Kengtung,<br>
  and in Rangoon and Mandalay divisions.
<p>The fasts were organized by members of the Myitkyina-based Kachin Baptist<br>
  Convention.
<p>The Kachin Independence Organization, the biggest ethnic Kachin ceasefire<br>
  group, which signed a truce with the Burmese military junta in February<br>
  1994, had no comment to make on the fast, a KIO official.
