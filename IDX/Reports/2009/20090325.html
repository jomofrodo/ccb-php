<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p> Thank you for all of your love and help.</p>
<p> Last week we had the first baptism of one our Shan FBR relief team leaders. 
  Sai Nawng is the leader and coordinator for the five Shan FBR relief teams. 
  All the other Shan team members are Buddhist as are most Shan people. The Free 
  Burma Rangers are open to people of any faith who want to serve there people 
  and stand with them in love. Each person knows they are free to believe as they 
  like and we are a close family of men and women from many ethnic groups.While 
  the FBR is made up of people of different ethnic groups and religions, we try 
  to share what God has done for us in our own lives and how we believe God wants 
  a relationship with all people. </p>
<p> Sai Nawng, the Shan team leader, began to ask about God and praying with my 
  father a year ago. He said he wanted to be led by God and to be a better person. 
  He said that he now had peace and because of God did not have to worry. So last 
  week when a Karen friend brought over five young Karen students who wanted to 
  be baptized at our new center, Sai Nawng said he wanted to be baptized as well.<br>
  We had friends from the US here (Dr. Bob, Elle, and John), some of our FBR Kachin 
  team, Dr. Mitch and Thai friends who all participated in the baptism service. 
  Sai Nawng was baptized first followed by the five Karen young people.
<p> This was not only a baptism of these six ethnic people from Burma, it was 
  also in a way, a baptism of our new center.
<p> We are thankful that God does love us and wants a relationship with each of 
  us. Thank you for your support, prayers and love, God bless you,
<p> Dave Eubank<br>
  CCB and FBR
