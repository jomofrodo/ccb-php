<p> 
<p>Dear friends,
<p> 
<p>This year on Sunday, March 8, thousands of people from all over the world will 
  join together in prayer for the people of Burma, on this, the 13th annual Global 
  Day of Prayer for Burma. We believe in the power of God through prayer to open 
  doors and to lead His people in the best way, even though sometimes it is through 
  the "valley of the shadow of death." We believe in the power of God to give 
  His people the good things of life, even if in the presence of the enemy. And 
  we believe in the power of God to keep for us the most precious things of life - that, 
  when the evening has come, He holds fast those things of eternal value. We believe 
  that this is true for the people of Burma and for all of us, and are grateful 
  for it. 
<p> 
<p>We are also grateful for each of you who are in this struggle with us and we 
  ask you to join with us in prayer on March 8. Many of you have received our 
  Day of Prayer brochure, which can help guide you in praying for Burma and introduce 
  you to some of the people we are praying for. If you have not, you can find 
  it on our website. Currently there are four translations posted: English, Thai, 
  Danish and French. Spanish will be up soon. 
<p> 
<p>Thank you and God bless you,
<p> 
<p>Christians Concerned for Burma
