<h2> Introduction: </h2>
<p> Dear Friends of the Wa, 
<p class="greytext">This report is written by Jesse Cusic, Logistics Director 
  for Free Burma Rangers and Christians Concerned for Burma. This past year Kay 
  Orsini, the Volunteer Wa Coordinator in Thailand, returned to the U.S. to help 
  take care of her children and grandchildren. Through her efforts the Wa ministry 
  has not only grown, it has become better organized and communications have improved. 
  As of this month, Josh Dunham has taken over as the new volunteer Wa coordinator 
  here in Chiang Mai. <br>
  God bless you,<br>
  Jesse Cusic 
<p> We thank you for continuing to care about and help the Wa people of northeastern 
  Burma and their cousins, the Lawa of Thailand. The Wa Hills of Burma are marked 
  on some maps of Southeast Asia, but even here in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, 
  they seem very far away. Not necessarily in distance as marked by miles or kilometers 
  but in accessibility. The drug trade and guns separate us from them and contribute 
  to the atmosphere of hostility and suspicion that hangs over both Wa State and 
  Shan State on the borders of Thailand, China, and Laos. It's in these two areas 
  where most Wa people live in Burma.
<p> Despite the hostile circumstances, God's grace has reached the Wa. In 1908 
  the first Wa became Christian. Over 50,000 Wa in Burma are believers and reportedly 
  there are over 100,000 Wa Christians in China. God is working through them and 
  others to overcome many challenges inside and outside of the Wa church. His 
  light continues to shine among the Wa.
<p> Dave, Karen and family spend most of their time on foot, on relief missions 
  in the war zones of the Karen, Karenni and Shan States, serving internally displaced 
  people. They have been able to serve and minister to Wa people in the Wa southern 
  relocation site in Shan States near the Thai border but, because of the Wa partnership 
  with the Burma dictators, they have not been able to go to the Wa areas of Burma 
  since 2000. They financially and prayerfully support the Wa pastors doing outreach 
  and then go where they can (that is, into the other ethnic areas where the Burma 
  Army is conducting attacks against the Karen, Karenni, and Shan people. In these 
  areas it is a Burma Army policy of shoot on sight but still they can move with 
  the ethnics who can usually avoid the Burma Army). 
<p> Narcotics, collusion with the dictators, conscripting children to fight in 
  the army, and attacking other ethnic groups make the United Wa State Army (UWSA) 
  an easy scapegoat. However the Wa people themselves have very little choice 
  and are but pawns in a deadly game. Animism continues to grip the people, and 
  the threat of attack by the Burma Army means that most Wa live in uncertainty 
  and fear. In spite of this, the church shines its light of God's love and freedom. 
  And in spite of many obstacles, the church keeps growing and the mission to 
  the Wa continues. Thank you for your part in that growth. When the Eubanks are 
  in Thailand they meet with the Wa Christian Fellowship (WCF) to pray, assess 
  the work, make plans and encourage each other. See photos about the Wa outreach 
  attached below. 
<p><span class="smalltext">Note (1): Lawa is the name 
  used for the ethnic Wa in Thailand, but Wa is the name of the language and the 
  people-group elsewhere in the region (Burma and China). There are an estimated 
  one million Wa people in the northern Wa area and China and about 200,000 in 
  the southern area north of the Thai border. In Thailand there are fewer than 
  100,000 ethnic Lawa immigrants, their children and grandchildren as well as 
  descendants of the original inhabitants of the northern Thailand area surrounding 
  Chiang Mai. </span>
<p><span class="smalltext">Note (2): The Wa Christian 
  Fellowship (WCF) is part of the 18th District of the Church of Christ of Thailand 
  (CCT). Pastor John Saniex, administrator of the Lawa Student Hostel, is a founding 
  member of the WCF and serves as secretary. He also pastors the Wa church of 
  Chiang Mai, which currently meets at the Hostel. </span>
<p>&nbsp;
<h2>Brief description of current projects:</h2>
<p> 1) Lawa Student Hostel - The Hostel is in Chiang Mai, Thailand, with 35 students, 
  grades 1-12, house parents - direct Presbyterian Church (USA) support - and 
  Rev. John Saniex and his wife who provide spiritual guidance and leadership 
  to the children. Thank you, Community Presbyterian Church of Vacaville, California, 
  for the salary and ministry of Wa pastor/evangelist John which are accounted 
  for by Allan Eubank. <br>
  Note: We have an immediate prayer request. Right now the Wa Hostel in Chiang 
  Mai is currently housing and supporting 35 students but there is really only 
  funding for 22 students. Now 4 students are attending university as well and 
  this increases the budget to be able to pay for their higher education. There 
  is an unused room at the hostel that the students would like to be able to use 
  as a study but shelves, desks, and lighting would be needed. Please pray for 
  more funding for food and also supplies to make a study room for the students. 
<p> 2) Evangelists - There are eight evangelists working full time in northern 
  Wa District that we support, six directly and two indirectly. Six are teacher-evangelists--five 
  based at the Ying Phaung hostel and school and one at Cao Tie village, the old 
  hostel site. One part-time evangelist-pastor travels to both sides of the border 
  and also on Wa evangelistic trips to the northern Wa District. Another Wa pastor-evangelist 
  travels the Thai side of the border and sharing the gospel with the Lawa people.
<p> 3) Evangelism trips - The Wa evangelists are engaged in teaching and preaching 
  at various villages in the northern Wa State area and in the southern region 
  as well. There are Lawa pastor trips across the border to preach and teach and 
  provide medical and relief supplies to poor Wa villagers. There is regular travel 
  by Lawa evangelists to Lawa villages in Thailand border areas. 
<p> 4) Northern District Ying Phaung Hostel and School - 31 impoverished Wa children 
  live and study at Ying Phaung Christian Hostel and School in the northern Wa 
  District near the border with China. Some have lost one or both parents and 
  some are from poverty-stricken families. An additional 32 more children attend 
  school during the day totaling 63 children touched by this ministry. The hostel 
  is in its sixth year, thanks to the Kachin and Wa missionaries who are faithfully 
  serving to witness for Christ in a poverty-stricken area. Through special gifts, 
  we have been able to provide support for 3-6 months of the year on average (in 
  addition to the teacher-evangelist salaries) and have depended on the Wa church, 
  the UN World Food Program and the grace of God for the balance.
<p> 5) Medical care - In the past, we have helped to provide medical care for 
  Wa people. The Lawa church provided help for some individuals who could not 
  afford their hospital bills. In February 2007, some Lawa pastors and church 
  members travelled across the border to a poor Wa village, Na Kawng Mu, in the 
  southern region and brought with them warm clothing, blankets and medicines 
  to treat the most common illnesses in that area.
<p> 6) Christian Literature - The work to translate, check, publish, and distribute 
  a complete Wa Bible, Old and New Testament, is ongoing. The 2006 Bible has now 
  been revised. Copies of the new revision are now being given to Wa people in 
  Burma and Thailand. Evangelism material and Sunday School materials in the Wa 
  language are being distributed in the southern Wa region by other mission groups 
  as well. 
<p>&nbsp;
<h2> Major activities of the past 24 months:</h2>
<p> 1) Lawa Student Hostel in Chiang Mai-The hostel is thriving with 35 young 
  people. Four of these students are now enrolled in university in Chiang Mai. 
  Most of the students come to Chiang Mai from villages and towns in northern 
  Thailand for a good public education and Christian nurture in a bi-lingual (Wa-Thai) 
  language environment. When volunteers are available, they teach English and 
  computers on the wonderful computers the Rotary donated. If you come to Chiang 
  Mai, be sure to stop by and meet the students, the hostel parents, Rev. John 
  Saniex and his wife, Sopha. It's thrilling to join the young people in worship 
  and singing at various times during the week. Evening worship is at 7:00 pm 
  and is often led by students. Here, it is clear that Christ is Lord of the nations. 
<p> 2) Rotary -- Rotary Clubs were instrumental in giving special facilities for 
  the new hostel building, such as the outdoor sanitation system, the four adjacent 
  outdoor bathrooms, and lots of needed equipment. Adele Anderson coordinated 
  the matching grant application with Rotary Clubs in Tempe, Arizona; Walla Walla, 
  Washington; and Chiang Mai, Thailand; and with Rotary Foundation. 
<p> 3) Ying Phaung Hostel -- The food supply for the children and staff at Ying 
  Phang hostel is still not secure. When we met in January 2008 in Chiang Mai 
  with Roi Ji, the Hostel Director, she brought news of a Wa District government 
  initiative to construct another school and hostel building on the 10 acre site. 
  She believes they will bring piped water to the hostel when they complete the 
  building-so it's better not ask for help to increase the hostel water storage 
  capacity at this time. In case the UN World Food Program ends the school rice-feeding 
  project, Roi Ji wants to put a plan for food-sufficiency in place now. The hostel 
  grows a vegetable garden to help feed themselves and corn for themselves and 
  for their five pigs and some chickens. She said they need five more pigs and 
  also fencing for the crops to keep cows, buffaloes and other animals out. They 
  lost half their corn crop last year to animals and she is concerned that the 
  tea trees they planted for a future cash crop (3 years to maturity) are getting 
  damaged as well. They would like to fence the entire area but do not have the 
  funds for that. Would you pray with us for food self-sufficiency for the Ying 
  Phaung Hostel children and staff? Thank you.
<p> 4) Evangelism in northern Wa Special District-- The six full-time evangelist/teachers 
  based at Ying Phaung continue their work sharing the gospel, strengthening believers 
  and teaching. A new Christian worker, Nyi Rung, has been called to serve as 
  pastor-evangelist and is supported by the Lawa Church in Chiang Mai. The Lawa 
  Church is working hard to support missions, as they are able. The Ying Phaung 
  evangelists focus their efforts for the most part on spiritual nurture of the 
  hostel children and the school children. Roi Ji said they have confidence in 
  our Lord that the children's faith will help lead their families to Him. They 
  pray that when the children complete their education, they will be able to nurture 
  others and become bridges for their people to live better lives through Christ. 
<p> 5) Evangelism in southern Wa areas-Across the Chiang Mai Province border with 
  Burma near Chiang Dao is an area of Wa village resettlements. Some time ago, 
  the Wa authorities forcibly relocated large numbers of Wa from their villages 
  in the north down to the southern border areas. Consequently, there are a number 
  of very poor villages just across the border. 
<p> There are 22 families in the Na Kawng Mu Church and some 50 families in the 
  whole village of Man Siang (named after their home village up north). They are 
  eager to share the gospel with their fellow villagers, but their helper, the 
  80 year old Lahu missionary pastor, is about to retire. He has been teaching 
  a dedicated layman who loves the Lord and is ready to start Bible teaching. 
  Pastor Banjong, on the Thai side of the border, wants to take on some evangelism 
  duties and to structure a training program for the lay teacher if he can cross 
  the border on a regular basis. Would you pray with us about support for this 
  possibility and for the safety of border crossings? It may take a budget of 
  about $100 a month to do this evangelism project. 
<p>&nbsp;
<h2>Changes in personnel, short-term objectives or emphases since beginning of 
  the project or last report:</h2>
<p> 1) The Lawa Christian Hostel in Chiang Mai is a wonderfully vital place. We 
  praise God that the new 2-story permanent dormitory building was completed. 
  Hostel ties with the local community have been strengthened. 
<p> 2) The WCF invited youth leaders to form a Lawa Youth Council in 2006. The 
  Youth hope to develop leadership skills, to mentor the younger members and to 
  lead the Lawa (Wa) community into challenging opportunities working with Wa 
  Christians in other countries of the region. Miss Uraiwan Kornlao, who is president 
  of the Lawa Hostel students and just graduated from high school, went with other 
  Lawa Church members to Mong Mao, Burma, for the Centenary Christian Jubilee 
  in April 2008. Because of her trip she was able to bring back a broader vision 
  of the Wa Church to share with the other students.
<p> Chiang Mai International School students have come to the hostel to help on 
  maintenance projects and to teach computer skills to the children for their 
  community service requirement. They also teamed with the Lawa students to paint 
  the old office. 
<p> 3) Please pray with us for Wa Christian workers in northern and southern Wa 
  areas of Burma and in Thailand, as well. See the paragraph above on evangelism 
  work across the border in the southern Wa region. Wa Christian workers many 
  times must continue forward on a wing and a prayer from fellow Christians around 
  the world because of lack of funding, strong local non-Christian opposition 
  to their work and internal divisions in the Wa church. 
<p> 4) Kay Orsini, the previous volunteer Wa coordinator, relocated to the US 
  at the end of March 2008 to spend time with her new grandchildren. Josh Dunham 
  has now come to take over her job as the volunteer Wa Coordinator. He is currently 
  living with the students at the hostel and is a real blessing to have help the 
  students in their studies as well as help administarte the current Wa projects.

<h2>Other matters you wish to share with the Presbyterian Church (USA):</h2>
<p> Thank you very much for your continuing support and prayers. The Wa Christian 
  Fellowship is very grateful to you and the Presbyterian Churches of the PC (USA). 
  We are all thankful to God who has brought us together even though we are on 
  opposite sides of the world. In spite of any obstacles, financial or other otherwise, 
  God's light is shining among the Wa and the darkness will not put it out. 
<p>&nbsp;
<h2> When might be a good time for a representative of the PC (USA) to visit the
