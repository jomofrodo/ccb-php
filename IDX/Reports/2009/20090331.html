<h1>Pictures from the 2009 Global Day of Prayer for Burma</h1>
<p>Dear Friends,
<p> Thanks to all of you who prayed for Burma on March 8, 2009, the 13th annual 
  Global Day of Prayer for Burma. We believe that God works though prayer and 
  leads in love, and that it is this love that is the foundation of the freedom 
  and change we seek and are working for in Burma. 
<p> We thank God for all of you, from all over the world, who united on this day 
  to pray that God bring peace, justice and reconciliation to the people under 
  oppression in Burma. We are grateful for a team that stretches from Alaska to 
  Australia, from the Czech Republic to Afghanistan, from Karen State to Scotland, 
  and many places in between that we don’t know about. Your prayers and support 
  help to keep hope alive in the people under attack, and it is this hope, fueled 
  by their faith and courage, that undergirds their steady refusal to give up 
  in the face of the dictators' unrelenting oppression.
<p> The pictures in this report were taken at two services: one in Karen State 
  where a group of displaced people gathered to pray. A candlelight prayer service 
  was held at midnight, and a church service was also conducted the following 
  morning, including a Good Life Club program for the children. The other service 
  was in a refugee camp. A special prayer was offered for Hsa K’tray Saw, the 
  young boy who was blinded by a Burma Army landmine and is now at a school for 
  the blind in Mae La refugee camp (see his story on the first page of the 2009 
  Day of Prayer magazine and also in reports starting in January 2008 at www.freeburmarangers.org 
  ). He was able to attend the service and expressed his thanks for all of you 
  who have prayed for and helped him in the last year.
<p> Thank you again for your continued support.
<p> God bless you,
<p> Christians Concerned for Burma
