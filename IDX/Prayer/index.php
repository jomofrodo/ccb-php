<font size="3">"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and 

greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. And whatever you ask in My name, 

that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, 

I will do it"-John 14:12-13</font>

            rape and forced labor. Pray God will be their comfort and strength 
            as they care for their children and families. </p>
          <p> &middot; God will be real to all of our brothers and sisters in 
            Burma who are suffering as a result of their faith. </p>
