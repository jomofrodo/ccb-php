The Attacked<br>
<b>2006 Offensive by Burma Army Displaces Over </b><br>
<b>25,000 Villagers in Northern Karen State</b><br>
The people in these photos are some of the over 25,000 <br>
displaced by the Burma Army in the worst offensive since <br>
1997. The unrelenting attacks in the Karen State are part of <br>
the plan by the dictators to completely dominate, chase out <br>
or crush any Karen people in these areas.<br>
While the scale of displacement and destruction <br>
is massive, people die individually, each death an <br>
irreplaceable loss. Saw They Shur was burned alive by <br>
Burma Army soldiers in his home at Play Hta Village, <br>
near Hoki, Toungoo District. He was 47 years old and <br>
married with six children. His wife and children are <br>
now in hiding. <br>
In April 2006 in Nyaunglebin District, we treated <br>
a 9-year-old girl, Naw Eh Ywa Paw, or the "Flower <br>
that Loves God" after she was shot (her father and <br>
<i>In hiding in Mon Township, Karen State, following </i><br>
grandmother were shot dead in the same attack). She <br>
<i>Burma Army attacks.</i><br>
is now on the run again with over 1,500 others in her <br>
valley. They were attacked for trying to stay with their <br>
families in a hiding place near their destroyed village. <br>
 <br>The disruption of their food production, the burning of <br>
their homes and the shoot-on-sight orders of the Burma <br>
Army have made staying in their homeland untenable <br>
for thousands more. They need immediate protection <br>
and the freedom to return to their homes. Because of <br>
these attacks they also need food, medicine, shelter and <br>
help to rebuild their homes, schools and lives.<br>

<i>The Flower that Loves God</i><br>
Dear friends,<br>
These are pictures of "the Flower that Loves <br>
God", a 9-year-old Karen girl who was shot and <br>
wounded while her father and grandmother were <br>
shot to death by the Burma Army in April 2006. <br>
She eventually recovered and with her mother, <br>
brother and sisters, moved to a new hiding place <br>
near their old village in Mon Township, Karen <br>
State. The Burma Army is now attacking the place <br>
where she and others are hiding, and she is on the <br>
run again. <br>
The Burma Army needs to be stopped, and she, <br>
her family and the other Karen need to be able to <br>
go home. Until that happens this is an emergency <br>
situation and she and her people need protection, <br>
food, medicine and shelter.<br>
Thank you and <br>
God bless you,<br>

With Displaced Karen in Burma:<br>
<b>A Message from a Relief Team</b><br>
We have spent most of the year on relief missions with <br>
some of the over one million displaced Karen, Karenni and <br>
Shan people in Eastern Burma as they fled Burma Army <br>
attacks. Bad things happen here, but I would like to share <br>
some of the good things, starting with an excerpt from a <br>
message we sent from the field.<br>
"Over 150 people in a long straggling line were moving <br>
towards us across the rice fields. One of our team members <br>
said, `Those are newly displaced people from Toungoo <br>
District who have been on the move for two weeks fleeing <br>
the Burma Army'. As I approached them I saw the strain <br>
on their faces and heard the babies crying. I suddenly felt <br>
<i>Karenni IDPs join in the Global Day of Prayer.</i> <br>
like I did not have much good news to share. That night, <br>
as our team and I spent time with these people, a different <br>
picture began to emerge: families huddled around small <br>
fires eating rice supplied by the local village and resistance <br>
invited us to join them and soon children were laughing <br>
and adults were smiling. We treated patients, talked and <br>
prayed with them. The next morning as they prepared <br>
to keep moving we joined them for prayer and our team <br>
sang the hymn "Holy, Holy, Holy" with them. When we <br>
finished, Naw Nancy, a 60-year-old Karen school teacher, <br>
said to us, `Thank you, but please wait, we want to sing for <br>
you and give you something'. All the people stood up as <br>
she led them in a Karen hymn, "God is Full of Power". We <br>
were all moved and departed with smiles and handshakes <br>

­ we to continue our mission, and they to a safer place."<br>
Burma Army had attacked a village destroying homes, <br>
Joy in the midst of difficulty; faith in the midst of<br>
looting possessions and burning the village church. It was <br>
uncertainty; choosing to be thankful instead of dwelling <br>
a thing of beauty to watch the Karens' agility and speed in <br>
on misery. These are the lessons the Karen people keep <br>
the jungle. They watched for the Burma Army but when <br>
teaching us. The following are a few of many other good <br>
we passed under a fruit tree, they stopped and climbed <br>
things the team and I have experienced on these missions.<br>
high in the tree to bring us some fruit. They exemplify <br>
men completely at home in their environment, sure of <br>
1) People like you, who pray for, encourage and support <br>
themselves yet not arrogant. They are fluid in motion and <br>
us. You care about these people; you choose to have an <br>
appreciative of all of nature's bounty. At the remains of the <br>
eternal perspective and you lift us up.<br>
village, these men looked at the destruction and then at us. <br>
2) The wonderful, amazingly capable and brave men and <br>
They shrugged and one man smiled saying, "We have to <br>
women who make up the relief teams. They are full of <br>
try. . this is our home. . we wil  not give up".                        <br>
love, humor, and the toughness to go anywhere needed.<br>

3) How people under direct Burma Army attack help each  We are reminded that evil is not the only power in the <br>
other. Even as some are killed, others run back to help the <br>
world. God is here with us, has suffered for us, and knows <br>
survivors, especially to carry the children.<br>
our suffering. Through it all, love triumphs and the soul <br>
4) For Eh Ywa Paw, the 9-year-old girl shot by the Burma <br>
cannot be killed. We are thus free to do what is right, to <br>
Army, and her survival.<br>
ask forgiveness when we do wrong and to try again. To <br>

build and rebuild, to love and serve and to enjoy all the <br>

gifts of life. This lesson was taught by you, by the Karen <br>
and yet only sees his family twice a year and has already <br>
people and I believe, by Jesus who shows us the way and <br>
spent seven years in prison. When asked why he endures <br>
with mercy, helps us on that way. For Christ's sacrifice and <br>
separation from his family and the risk of capture or death, <br>
friends like you I am grateful.<br>
he said with a smile, "For the freedom of my people".<br>

captured by the <br>
Burma Army <br>
when she was <br>
5 years old, has <br>
been missing <br>
for seven years. <br>
She is reported <br>
dead, sacrificed <br>
at the Ho Mong <br>
temple by <br>
Burma Army <br>
troops.<br>
This Shan family fled their village in Shan State where <br>
<i>Nang Sap at 4 years old. </i><br>
they had been forced to work for the Burma Army under <br>
There are multiple eyewitness accounts of her capture <br>
brutal conditions. The father was addicted to opium and <br>
by the Burma Army, which put her in a backpack and <br>
the mother to amphetamines. They told us the Burma <br>
took her to a new pagoda being built in Ho Mong, <br>
Army gave them drugs as payment and to keep them <br>
Shan State. There she was reportedly entombed with <br>
under control. Their two little daughters were dirty and <br>
two other children as a sacrifice. Her mother is still in <br>
malnourished. They had been walking for days and hiding <br>
trauma. This is not the only case of human sacrifice <br>
from Burma Army and Wa Army patrols as they escaped <br>
that has been reported.<br>
to the south. They told us they heard that the Shan pro-<br>
democracy resistance had a protected area for displaced <br>
people like them and that the Shan State Army could help <br>
them kick their drug dependencies. We were glad to lead <br>
them there, and put the family in the center of our column <br>
as we headed back to this protected area.<br>
It became very difficult for the family to move fast as the Burma <br>
and Wa armies pursued us, even though we were already carrying <br>
their two girls and belongings. We had to give the mother an IV <br>
and were just able to get them to the safe area. <br>
Two years later we were preparing for a mission deeper <br>
inside and met this family again. They were in the same <br>
safe area of displaced people that we had brought them <br>
to. We were amazed at how healthy and strong they were. <br>
They smiled when we met. They had been off all narcotics <br>

<b>Message From an FBR Relief </b><br>
<b>Team Leader:</b><br>
These pictures of people praying, <br>hiding, fleeing and of a medic carrying <br>a child to safety show faith, suffering, <br>uncertainty, love in action and hope. <br>In Proverbs 3:5-6, we are urged, "Trust <br>in the LORD with all your heart and <br>lean not on your own understanding; <br>in all your ways acknowledge Him, <br>and He will make your paths straight." <br>It is not easy to trust God with all of <br>our hearts, especially when we suffer. <br>
<i>Villagers on the run from Burma Army attacks in Eastern Burma. </i>But there is no other way to live with <br>
faith than to give God our whole <br>hearts no matter what each of us are <br>facing wherever we are. May we give <br>ourselves wholeheartedly to God as He <br>leads us on.<br> <br>Thank you for your prayers and for <br>your stand with the people of Burma. <br>
God Bless you, <br><i>A Relief Team Leader<br></i>Free Burma Rangers <br>
