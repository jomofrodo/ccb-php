        <p> Dear Friends, </p>
        <p> Thank you for taking time to pray for Burma. As the passage at the 
          bottom of every page says, <EM>Zechariah 4:6, "Not by might nor by power, 
          but by My Spirit."</EM> </p>
        <P>You join many all over the world who are praying for Burma this week. 
          Please continue to pray throughout the year and let us know if you need 
          more information on Burma, or would like to help out in any way. Below 
          are all the details for this year's Global Day of Prayer for Burma. 
          Please use this information in the days leading up to March 10, 2002. 
        </P>
        <p> Blessings, </p>
        <p> Christians Concerned for Burma </p>
