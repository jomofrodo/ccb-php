<h1> Wa and Narcotics </h1>
<img src="images/crutches.jpg" border="0"> 
<p> Narcotic production and trafficking in Burma provides the SPDC with a major 
  source of revenue. In 1999 alone, 1,750 tons of opium was grown and processed 
  into heroin. Over 50 new methamphetamine laboratories are now located along 
  Burma. s eastern border with Thailand, and over 500 million methamphetamine 
  tablets were trafficked into Thailand this year. The profits from this trade 
  in narcotics helps to support the SPDC. s 400,000-man army in its mission to 
  crush all dissent in Burma. </p>
<p> The SPDC has encouraged some of Burma. s ethnic groups to produce narcotics 
  in return for limited autonomy and a halt to attacks by the Burma Army. Those 
  groups that produce narcotics and share their revenue with the SPDC can have 
  relative peace and autonomy. Ethnic groups which have no involvement with narcotics, 
  such as Karen, Karenni, Chin, Arakan, and some Shan, are attacked relentlessly 
  by the SPDC. s army and they struggle to survive. </p>
<p> The few groups that are involved in the narcotics trade use their profits 
  to buy food and other necessities as well as to buy arms. Narcotics profits 
  are shared with the SPDC in return for cash, basic goods and limited political 
  rights. Greed is also a factor, but while some ethnic leaders are motivated 
  by selfish ambition, most see narcotics as the only way for their people to 
  survive. </p>
<p> Narcotics are not only a means for the SPDC to gain revenue, they also provide 
  opportunities to corrupt and divide the ethnic minorities of Burma. While the 
  ethnic groups are certainly not innocent, they feel they have no real choice 
  but to participate in the narcotics industry. With no one to turn to for protection 
  and sustenance, some groups have chosen narcotics as the only means to feed 
  and provide security for their people. </p>
<p> In 1999 the SPDC encouraged the Wa (United States Wa Army) to relocate 150,000 
  of its people from Northern Wa State down to Southern Shan State near the Thai 
  border. This relocation has not only paralleled the explosion of narcotic trafficking 
  into neighboring countries such as Thailand, it has also resulted in a great 
  increase of resentment and hatred by the Shans and others whose lands have now 
  been invaded by the Wa and other SPDC supported groups. All of this is part 
  of the SPDC. s strategy of "divide and rule". Dissension between ethnic groups 
  is crucial to the dictators. hold on power. This movement of the Wa into Shan 
  territory is only the latest example. </p>
