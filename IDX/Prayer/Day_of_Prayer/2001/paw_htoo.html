  <h2> PAW HTOO, Golden Flower </h2>
  <div class="quote"> "There is no hopelessness in this world, save our own refusal 
    to allow the suffering around us to move us to love and action". </div>
  <p> <u>Dialogue with a Dream</u>, by Max Ediger, a man working for peace in 
    Burma</p>
  <p> Paw Htoo' s life is one that encourages many to continue their struggle 
    for a peaceful life in Burma and one that encourages perseverance and faith. 
    Her incredible story continues to touch lives and inspire many. </p>
  <p> Paw Htoo, which means Golden Flower, is 30 years old, a Karen lady, and 
    a Christian. Her heart is generous and her hands caring as she joins teams 
    that provide relief and medical care for people who are suffering from her 
    country. Her past struggles seem insurmountable, but she has overcome them 
    to serve her people as a medic. </p>
  <p> She grew up in a village where Burmese soldiers often stole the villagers. 
    rice and chicken. The soldiers also took people as porters, beating the people 
    who refused to join them. Her father died when she was 15 years old. In 1991 
    she met a Karen soldier and a year later they were married on the front lines 
    of the battle with the Burmese. Soon after their marriage their group was 
    attacked by Burmese soldiers. Paw Htoo. s husband was shot in the arm and 
    captured by the Burmese who then cut his throat and shot him twice in the 
    head. She wanted to stay with him, but was not able to. </p>
  <p> Paw Htoo was caught when fleeing the attack and though three months pregnant, 
    was put in jail. Her son was born in the jail during her two-year term. There 
    was not enough food in the jail to raise a child, so her mother-in-law came 
    to take the child and is now raising him in her village. Paw Htoo was released 
    after two years and returned to Karen territory. The last time she saw her 
    son was in 1998 when he was six-years-old. She is not able to see him at this 
    time because the village is controlled by Burmese soldiers. </p>
  <p> Her service and love has given many people hope because there is someone 
    who cares. Please pray for Paw Htoo and for the people she tries to help and 
    care for. </p>
