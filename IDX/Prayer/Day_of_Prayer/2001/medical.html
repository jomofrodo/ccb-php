  <P>He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lord 
    sets prisoners free, the Lord gives sight to the blind, the Lord lifts up 
    those who are bowed down.. Psalm 146:7-8</P>

  <P>In spite of the attacks of the Burma Army the people of Burma have not given 
    up. In the jungle mobile clinics provide care for victims of the Burma Army. 
  </P>
  <P>"We have to have faith and do our best," were the words of a chief medic 
    as he trained 33 new medics and helped care for the sick and wounded. </P>
  <P>Mobile teams travel with great risks to bring hope and help to people fleeing 
    attack. Even with limited resources the ethnic groups are able to endure and 
    make the best of their bleak situation. For example, land mine victims are 
    routinely rescued by medics and amputations are performed without anesthetics, 
    in the field or on the floor of a bamboo hut. In spite of these difficulties 
    most victims are saved and the surgical skill demonstrated by the medics is 
    equal to that of trained surgeons. The people have not given up and they are 
    doing their best to survive in the midst of oppression by Burma. s dictatorship. 
  </P>
  <P>An old IDP man expressed his thoughts on the situation, "We pray and we work 
    and we are happy most of the time. Sometimes we are afraid, sometimes we have 
    to run, but we always want to come back. We won. t leave our land."</P>
