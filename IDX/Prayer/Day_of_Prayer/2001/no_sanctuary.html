<p> <i>" In the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In the secret 
  place of his tabernacle he shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock.". 
  Psalm 27:5 </i></p>
<p>   The ethnic people of Burma as well as the Burman people continue their struggle 
  for basic human rights, democracy, and freedom. Dictators have ruled Burma since 
  1962 using force to relocate entire communities and implementing a brutal . 
  four cuts. strategy to silence all dissent. Since the bloody crushing of the 
  1988 democracy movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burma Army has intensified 
  its attacks on all the people, but especially the ethnic groups who still resist 
  their rule. Due to the oppression of the dictators of Burma there are approximately 
  2 million people inside Burma who have been displaced from their homes. For 
  most displaced ethnic Burmans, approximately 1 million, relocation has been 
  by force in order to make more land available for the regime. s business projects. 
  These displaced Burmans live in or near large urban centers firmly under the 
  regime. s control. </p>
<p> For the ethnic minorities who comprise over 40 percent of Burma. s population, 
  the situation is much worse. In the minority areas such as the Karen, Karenni, 
  and Shan states, up to 1 million people have been forced to leave their homes 
  with only what they can carry and live in relocation sites where their freedom 
  is severely restricted and their treatment brutal. In the Karen and Karenni 
  states alone, over 200,000 are languishing in these sites. The villagers. livestock 
  are usually confiscated and their villages are burned to the ground. Many areas 
  are then mined to prevent villagers from returning. In some cases the villagers 
  are not allowed to go to a relocation site, but are attacked by the Burma Army, 
  murdered, raped, chased into the jungle along with having their villages burned 
  down. </p>
<p> The regime. s stated purpose is to "crush all resistance" and to "punish" 
  the ethnic groups. The result of this scorched-earth policy is that many have 
  fled their homes or the brutal conditions of the relocation sites. These people 
  (over 400,000 in Karen and Karenni States) are currently hiding in the jungle 
  along the Thai-Burma border. They are in need of security, medical care, clothing, 
  school supplies, moral encouragement and spiritual support. </p>
<p> Pictured on this page is a burnt IDP settlement that used to be home to 4,000 
  people. The site was attacked and destroyed by the Burma Army on April 4, 2000. 
  For many who have fled this place, it is not the first time they have had their 
  houses burned and their communities destroyed. Pray for an end to the terrible 
  destruction. </p>
