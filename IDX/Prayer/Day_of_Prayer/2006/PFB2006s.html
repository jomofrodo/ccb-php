        Dear Friends,<br>
        Thank you for your prayers and support for the people of Burma. Though 
        they are suffering under an oppressive dictatorship, they have not given 
        up hope. Through 55 years of civil war the people continue to find ways 
        to work and pray for positive change. Love is alive in Burma and its light 
        will not be put out. Please join the people of Burma in prayer for their 
        country, as we believe true freedom will not come only through political 
        change but through the healing power of God's love.</p>
      <p><br>
        Please use this booklet, poster, and bulletin insert as a guide for prayer 
        and tools for action. Please see www.prayforburma.org for updates on the 
        situation of displaced people inside Burma and for more resources.</p>
      <p><br>
        God bless you,<br>

      <p>Dear Friends,<br>
        Thank you for sending gifts for the children of Burma. The Good Life Club 
        Kid-Packs, Mom&amp;Baby Packs, smile-hats and T-shirts have been given 
        to hundreds of children since 2001. These displaced children have been 
        blessed by your generosity and thoughtfulness. If you would like to receive 
        a short DVD about the Good Life Club, please contact us.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Using the supplies from the packs, we are able to give the newly trained 
        relief teams resources to teach villagers about good hygiene and nutrition. 
        We've even included a basic health-care presentation in the team's supplies, 
        such as puppets and a script for education and entertainment. The packs 
        are distributed constantly as the relief teams continue to travel throughout 
        the war-torn areas of Burma.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The situation of the Internally Displaced People of Burma is still dire 
        and in need of our love, prayers, and relief supplies. Your gifts for 
        the children prove to them that they are not forgotten and that people 
        around the world do care and want to be involved in their lives. The kind 
        messages, prayers, and bible verses bring hope that God will be with them 
        daily and meet their needs. The children of Burma may one day see an end 
        to the war that has held this country captive for 50 years. Thank you 
        again for keeping alive the belief that they are valuable and can live 
        each day in hope of<br>
        an abundant life.</p>
