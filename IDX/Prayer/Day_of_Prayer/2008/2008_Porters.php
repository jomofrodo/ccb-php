      <p>The Burma Army forces both villagers and prisoners to work as porters. 
        The Burma Army has used more than 1,700 prisoner porters in their current 
        offensive in northern Karen State which began in February 2006. More than 
        256 have been reported dead, many of whom were executed. Among the porters 
        in Papun Distict alone, there are more than 20 child porters (boys under 
        16 years old from Insein Prison). 
      <p>The Burma Army is now using the term “transporter” or woon htan instead 
        of “prisoner porter” to describe the people they force to carry their 
        loads. 
      <p>The following information is from escaped porters, Burma Army deserters 
        and villagers who have seen the bodies of dead porters. Porters are beaten 
        and poorly fed. If they cannot carry loads they are often beaten to death 
        or shot. Some who become sick are given an injection of an unknown drug 
        and these porters reportedly die within a few hours. 
      <p>Porters who were killed by the Burma Army or who died from sickness as 
        they carried loads: 
      <p><b>Nyaunglebin District:</b> Of the more than 400 porters used in this 
        area, more than 20 have died. 
      <p><b>Papun District:</b> Of the more than 700 porters used in this area, 
        150 porters died by torture, by execution and by sickness (dysentery is 
        the most often cited). 
      <p><b>Toungoo District:</b> Of the more than 600 prisoner porters, 95 were 
        killed. Some were reportedly killed because their throats were cut, and 
        others starved to death. Note: Not counted yet are any of the deaths resulting 
        from the more than 850 villagers used to carry loads for the Burma Army. 
      <p><b>Total*: 1,700 porters, 265 dead. </b> 
      <p><i>(*Totals as of December 2006) </i>
