      <h1>Faith and Doubt </h1>
      <p>It often seems that we here are easily swayed by our circumstances. I 
        was writing a message to friends under attack in Burma and ending the 
        message with Proverbs 3:5 6. Later I realized I had left out the part 
        that says “with all your heart.” It is difficult for most of us, I think, 
        to trust God with all of our hearts. I am very grateful for your prayers 
        and God’s mercy to help us do that. We will try daily to trust God with 
        our whole hearts and for me it is like a choice between the planting and 
        growing of two different trees: one called Doubt, the other Faith. 
      <p>There are two trees before me I can help to grow. One is the tree of 
        doubt. This one is easy to see, and has a clear, seemingly straight shot 
        to the sky. It grows fast. But every time I put energy into helping that 
        tree grow—and grow it does—the fruit that comes is poison with all of 
        poison’s effects to me and others. 
      <p>The other tree is called faith, and is much harder to grow. It is often 
        choked by weeds and we seem to be standing in a thicket where we can not 
        even see the sky. But the efforts of faith, prayer, the help of others 
        as well as clinging to God for help, makes it grow—however slowly. The 
        wonderful thing is that the fruit of this tree is good in every way. And 
        it is the fruit of this tree by which God gives us an insight into His 
        view. By this fruit we can see some of the results of faith. Faith, by 
        earthly definition, cannot be seen, but by the good fruit that comes from 
        it, God has given us an insight into it. He has given us something tangible 
        to hold on to. My prayer for you is the same as it is for me: to choose 
        to grow the tree of faith and hold on to God for the strength to do it. 
      <p>Thank you and may God bless you all, <br>
