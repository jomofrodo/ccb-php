      <span class="greytext">From a relief-team leader: </span>
      <p>During a relief mission, one of our team members asked to be baptized. 
      <p>His name is Saw Hser Wah (“Sweet White”) and he was an animist from the 
        Toungoo area of the Karen State. He joined one of the FBR teams this year 
        as a communications specialist. As you know, we have people of many faiths 
        on our teams and all are welcome. In the Karen area most team members 
        are Christians but not all. We had just held a meeting with our headquarters 
        team and the team Hser Wah is on and they volunteered to go on a mission 
        to a particularly dangerous area. 
      <p>Hser Wah came up to us and said, “Tomorrow we set out on a new mission 
        and maybe I will die. If I die, I do not know what will happen to me. 
        I want to give my life to God and be baptized because if I do so, even 
        if I die, I know I will be with God. Please, if you have time, baptize 
        me.” 
      <p>Hser Wah was baptized in a stream at a fork in the trail where our teams 
        were heading west and his team was heading north. The local people, all 
        IDPs—some animist and some Christian—joined in the service. We thanked 
        God and one month later met up with Hser Wah and his team again. 
      <p>He said, “See I am still alive and now that I belong to God I am not 
        afraid but I am also in no hurry to die either!”
