<h2>Global Day of Prayer for Burma, 2008 </h2>
<h1>As Good As It Gets </h1>
<h3> <i>A story from a relief mission in Burma </i></h3>

    <td valign="top"> 
      <p>Last week we were providing relief to a group of Karen people in their 
        hiding place. These people had fled their homes when the Burma Army attacked 
        and were living in lean-tos and makeshift shelters in the jungle. We had 
        been in this area since early January and had just about exhausted our 
        medical and other relief supplies. The medics were able to treat most 
        of the cases we saw and the two cases that we could not treat we were 
        able to evacuate. 
      <p>It was just getting dark when a man came up to me carrying an old woman. 
        “This is my grandmother,” he said. “She is 97 years old and has been blind 
        for four years; can you help her?” 
      <p>I said a quick silent prayer, and thought that probably the only help 
        we could give was love and some vitamins. Her grandson set her gently 
        down in front of me, as all the medics were busy. She squatted down with 
        her thin arms dangling down beside her legs. She began to shake. I asked 
        her if she was cold and she said yes. I got a Good Life Club jacket that 
        Partners had donated and put it on her. She smiled broadly and said repeatedly, 
        “Thank you, thank you.” 
      <p>Her eyes were squeezed tight and with the help of her grandson we opened 
        them for examination. Her eyes were small, misshapen and looked partially 
        dissolved. They did not look much like eyes anymore. I asked the medics 
        their opinion and they said, “She has been blind a long time, is very 
        old, and so there is no way to fix those now.” I told her we could not 
        help her eyes and I got some vitamins from the medics and gave them to 
        her grandson with instructions. And then I prayed for her. That was it; 
        no healing and no treatment for her eyes. The grandson then smiled and 
        as he started to pick her up, he thanked us again. 
      <p>She held out her arms and grabbed him tightly from behind, drawing her 
        legs up so that he could carry her on his back. She looked secure there 
        and laid her head against his shoulder. As they walked away I almost began 
        to cry. There she was, all folded up on her grandson’s back, with her 
        new GLC jacket with the smiley face logo shining. Off they went to their 
        hiding place with no healing, no promise of security and no certain future. 
        But for the moment she seemed content and was warm and I thought, “This 
        is as good as it gets.” 
      <p>We want to help everyone, we want to be part of real change in Burma, 
        but in reality sometimes we cannot do very much. But the little we each 
        can do is sometimes as good as it gets here. We thank you all and all 
        the individuals and organizations that are working together to make positive 
        change for Burma. We thank God that in this life of triumphs and tragedy, 
        of contentment and distress, there are good things that happen and with 
        love, there is always a way. 
      <p>God bless you, 
      <p><i>A relief-team leader </i>
