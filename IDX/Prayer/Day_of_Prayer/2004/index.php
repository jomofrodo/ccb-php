      <p>Dear Friends,</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">You are all invited to join in prayer 
        with the people of Burma and others around the world on March 14, 2004. 
        The country of Burma has been engulfed in civil war for the past 54 years. 
        You can stand with the people of Burma by praying for their physical and 
        spiritual freedom, informing others about the situation, and asking God 
        to lead you to do something more.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Thank you for working with us to show 
        our neighbors in the world who are suffering. We all need support and 
        prayers in this effort.</p>
      <p>Blessings,</p>
      <p>Christians Concerned for Burma</p>
