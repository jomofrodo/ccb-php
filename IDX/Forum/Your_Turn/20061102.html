<h1>"Run Rangers, Run"</h1>
<p> The soft sigh of the jungle is suddenly shattered,<br>
  As rain falls like tears from the Ancient of Days.<br>
  Hear the screams of the dying as they fall to the rifle<br>
  Bodies are pierced, by the bullets it sprays.<br>
  Run Rangers, run, for your people are calling,<br>
  Listen to the sound of your pain on the breeze.<br>
  Shoulder your packs and go seek out the dying,<br>
  Hiding and living under cover of trees.<br>
  IDPs stumble along jungle tracks seeking<br>
  A place, for a moment, they can lay their tired heads.<br>
  Homes have been ravaged, their possessions all burning,<br>
  Their children are stolen, their mothers lie dead.<br>
  Love Rangers, love, give your heart to the battle.<br>
  You're a hope for the hopeless as they flee for their life.<br>
  Take in your provisions and tend to the wounded,<br>
  The children, the widows and man without wife.<br>
  Rat-tat-tat go machine guns, spewing their poison,<br>
  As the soldiers of Burma another village make clear.<br>
  Ethnic cleansed landscapes huddle in shadow,<br>
  While the ashes of hatred speak of their fear.<br>
  Pray Rangers, pray, as you crouch behind saplings,<br>
  Barring the way of the Burma Army's advance.<br>
  As Karen run on swiftly, crossing the hilltops,<br>
  Never surrender while freedom has chance.<br>
  Landmines explode with the voice of destruction<br>
  Primed like venomous spiders buried in pits.<br>
  A young boy goes searching for food for his family,<br>
  A footstep placed wrongly, his leg's blown to bits.<br>
  Stay Rangers, stay, and give ease to their spirits.<br>
  They have souls that know violence but never know rest.<br>
  They lie down on hard ground on mats they have woven,<br>
  Grieved that though they are homeless, even sparrows have nests.<br>
  As I sat drinking coffee, with no fears for the future, <br>
  No sad jungle echoes would resound in my head. <br>
  But like the wind moaning, I heard the faint whispers <br>
  Rising in volume, crying out things you had said.<br>
  Speak Rangers, speak, and tell us their stories<br>
  Awake us from slumber and show us the light.<br>
  We once stumbled in blindness but now catch the vision,<br>
  As you show us the path and bring us into the fight.<br>
  Now, night after night I trek into Burma,<br>
  My mind takes me places as I fall off to sleep.<br>
  As I run with the Rangers on nocturnal excursions,<br>
  My arms are embracing the mothers that weep.<br>
