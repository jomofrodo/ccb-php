  <h1>Life on the &quot;Road to Jericho&quot;<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>: 
    Would You Engage or Turn Away?<o:p></o:p></b></h1>
 <p>
    Robert Seiple, former president of World Vision, once challenged us, particularly&nbsp;as 
    Christians, to make responsible choices and be engaged responsibly in the 
    world's affairs.&nbsp; He alluded to the importance of the Good Samaritan 
    spirit and analogized our world as another Jericho Road.&nbsp; I can vividly 
    remember the parable as my mother read it to me when I was very young.&nbsp; 
    The simple but courageous act of the Samaritan has stuck in my mind ever since, 
    especially as I struggle with the crisis going on in Burma.<br>
    <br>
    Jesus Christ tells us this story of the Good Samaritan in the Bible (Luke 
    10:25-37) as he answered the question of whom we should consider our neighbors.&nbsp; 
    I was profoundly moved by the story since I first heard it more than twenty 
    years ago.&nbsp; But it&nbsp;has been only recently that I discovered, or 
    rather, could characterize the diametrically different perspectives, of the 
    Samaritan, on the one hand, and of the Levite and the Priest, on the other.&nbsp; 
    Encountering the same incident, the Samaritan ponders: what will happen to 
    the mugged man if I do not stop and help him, whereas, the Priest and the 
    Levite question: what would happen to me if I stop and help the man?&nbsp; 
    All three of them acted according to their own instinctive and intrinsic values 
    in life.&nbsp; The Samaritan helped the mugged man, but the Priest and the 
    Levite turned away from the man.<br>
    <br>
    Today, as we&nbsp;walk on our road to &quot;Jericho&quot;, many of us often 
    find ourselves,&nbsp;like the Priest and the Levite, in the situation of asking 
    the second question and getting the answer of excuse to avoid the many responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
    crisis in Burma&nbsp;is the allegoric road, involving the sight of pain and 
    suffering, resulting from human rights violations. In the face of grotesque 
    injustices committed by a powerful military regime that has triggered thousands 
    of innocent people to flee their homes, which of the two questions would we 
    ask ourselves?&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I pause for a while and think about it 
    seriously, I invariably end up in silent weeping, but I know that the suffering 
    people need more than sympathy and tears.&nbsp; To relate this to Seiple’s 
    message: &quot;Success is illusive. It is wrong to keep score.&nbsp; It is 
    right to embrace the interruption, faithfully and obediently, that God puts 
    in our path.&quot;&nbsp; Living in the world that resembles so much the circumstances 
    of the road to Jericho, we sometime would like to reach our destination within 
    the quickest possible time, and ignore those who need our help on the way.<br>
    <br>
    One other Biblical figure that inspires me so very much is Esther.&nbsp; For 
    &quot;such a time as ours&quot; in Burma, the Book of Esther can teach us 
    the most vital and pragmatic ways to respond to the hardship, injustices and 
    challenges facing us.&nbsp; Esther speaks boldly and truthfully in defense 
    of her people.&nbsp; She uses her stature and speaks out in favor of justice.&nbsp; 
    Perhaps Daw Aung San Suu Kyi may have been inspired by the spirit of Esther 
    when she said, &quot;use your freedom and speak out to the world to promote 
    ours.&quot;  It seems appropriate here to recall what may be the most famous 
    lines of Martin Luther King Jr., from a letter he wrote while incarcerated 
    in the Birmingham jail: &quot;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&quot;&nbsp; 
    If this statement is true, it calls our attention to be seriously concerned 
    about any and every injustice carried out by any group or government in every 
    corner of the world.&nbsp; In the same line of logic, we are constantly threatened 
    and morally challenged by what is going on in the deep jungles of Burma, regardless 
    of where we live.<br>
    <br>
    Jesus told us the story of the Good Samaritan to draw a sharp and revealing 
    contrast between the way things are and the way&nbsp;things should be, and 
    I am convinced that, as a believer in Christ, we must be sensitive and responsive 
    to the injustices that we witness. The question, then, is: What should we 
    do when we are faced with injustice?&nbsp; Must we be blind to the suffering 
    of our neighbors?&nbsp; Or, must we allow ourselves to be interrupted by the 
    mugged man and make a difference in the lives of others?&nbsp; It is a very 
    difficult question to answer, especially when the evil is&nbsp;so strong.&nbsp; 
    Under the circumstances, we may just do well to remember to pray&nbsp;and 
    recite the oft-quoted prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr, the noted German-American 
    theologian: &quot;God, grant me serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
    the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. 
    . . . Amen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>
