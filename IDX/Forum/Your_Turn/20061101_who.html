<h1> WHO</h1>
<p>WHO WILL SPEAK OUT FOR THE CHILD WHO HAS NO HOME<br>
  WHO WILL TAKE THE HAND OF THE WIDOW WHO WALKS ALONE<br>
  WHO WILL SHOW THEIR FAITH BY ALL THEY DO<br>
  WHO WILL WORSHIP ME IN SPIRIT AND TRUTH<br>
  WHO WILL BRAVE THE ROAD TO COMFORT THE OPPRESSED<br>
  WHO WILL HEAR MY VOICE AND GO<br>
  SO SOMEONE WILL BE BLESSED<br>
  WHO WILL GIVE ALL OF THEIR LIFE TO ME<br>
  AND FIGHT FOR JUST ONE SOUL TO BE SET FREE<br>
  WHO WILL BE MY VOICE FOR THE REFUGEE<br>
  WHO WILL BE MY HANDS AND FEET TO BURMA'S I.D.P.s<br>
  WHO WILL KNOW MY HEART AND FIGHT ON THEIR KNEES<br>
  WHO WILL WEEP WITH ME<br>
  WHO WILL BE MY VOICE FOR THE CHILD SOLD AS A BRIDE<br>
  WHO WILL BE MY HANDS TO THE ORPHANS WHOSE EYES HAVE DIED<br>
  WHO WILL BE MY FEET IN THE JUNGLES WHERE MY PEOPLE HIDE<br>
  WHOSE HEART WILL BE BREAKING INSIDE
