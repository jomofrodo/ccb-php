<h1 >Woman With A Red Scarf</h1>
<p >She is born to an innocent woman <br>
  Who happens to be an ethnic Karen. <br>
  Her parents work as hard as ants, <br>
  to bring their only child to Kawthoolei, <br>
  Their ancestral land&nbsp; <br>
  Kawthoolei is a heritage of the Karen <br>
  Which is inside Burma <br>
  Karen’s capital state of Pa-an <br>
  Is ruled by dictator junta <br>
  The land which everyone wants <br>
  The daughter of the Karen woman <br>
  speaks in Karen dialect which makes the Burmese dictator mad <br>
  When she performs a Karen traditional dance <br>
  She wears a white dress and a white scarf on her head <br>
  To show that she is pure and innocent <br>
  Day in and out the invader dictator <br>
  Comes in to conquer her land <br>
  He burns the children in midday sun <br>
  And destroys the father and the son <br>
  She hops as fast as a calf with her head band white scarf <br>
  He seizes her on the shoulder <br>
  And drags her down on the floor <br>
  She begs her predator with all her heart <br>
  But he makes her dress turns to dark <br>
  He strikes her throat apart and wraps it with her white scarf <br>
  She lies motionless with her neck scar.
