<h2>TENASSARIM</h2>
<h4> by Drucie Bathin</h4>
<p>I used to walk down the aisles, but now I orbit from up high.<br>
  With my opal light so bright, I see the world all sides.<br>
  When I look down to the south pole, I see only empty white snow.<br>
  But when I look on to Burma country, all it beauty, rich land of TENASSARIM.<br>
  Is given from God.
<p>In the ever green valley of TENASARI, my people my pets lives joyfully. <br>
  From teak trees, branches on out, I see rainbows all around.<br>
  In the land where I used to step, precious stones sparkle underneath.<br>
  Every place I glace, I see amazing grace.<br>
  Beauty, beauty. 
<p>Golden land of TENASSARIM, Oh my mother, I adore you.<br>
  With you in mind, I live on cumulus, as proud as a peacock.<br>
  Peaceful, quiet, no cry heard. <br>
  Paradise, heaven is no better.<br>
  Suddenly a sharp noise, what? From what? I ask<br>
  Vampire, hey vampire.
<p>Shoot in and out aiming at us, Oh, God, Oh my savior. <br>
  Screaming, mourning, can anyone help. Please help?<br>
  From the teak tree I look down, red blood all around.
<p> In the land where I used to step, <br>
  Bloodshed flows and flows.<br>
  Beauty and blood
<p>You flee, I fly to free our lives, to an open land, where vampires can not 
  hide. <br>
  Oh mom, Oh dad, I would fly back to see if you live. <br>
  My soul and heart are broken up , you in vampire’s trash.<br>
  Weep and pray to your god to allow you more breath, more space.<br>
  I weep and pray just to see you once again.
<p>After my flight that brutal night, I don’t come back for a time. <br>
  In my mind what do I see, human being live frightfully. <br>
  My sense hurt my eyes purple, I can’t open them so long.<br>
  Just once a month I will come and shine on TENASSARIM.
<p> I bear what you suffer, until you can come home.
