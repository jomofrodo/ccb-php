  <h1>Freedom From Fear </h1>

  <p><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"> <span class="bodyCopy">What is Democracy? Why do 
    people want to fight for a democracy, and why do they want it? People are 
    yelling out "freedom" and sacrificing their lives to get freedom, it indicates 
    that they want human rights. What is "human rights" and how do we understand 
    it? </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> According to Universal Declaration 
    of Human Rights, adopted by UN General Assembly Resolution 217 A of 10 December 
    1984, "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable 
    rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice 
    and peace in the world…" In which it is simply stated that everyone has the 
    right to life, liberty and security of person. </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> Everyone has the right to 
    recognition everywhere as a person before the law. All are equal before the 
    law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the 
    law. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. 
    Everyone has the right to freedom to opinion and expression. Everyone, without 
    any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy">History will not ever be disappeared 
    in Burma. It was the unforgettable moment that we, Burmese people, respectfully 
    bow to those who have sacrificed their lives struggling for democracy and 
    human rights. Twelve years ago, on 13th March 1988, the peaceful demonstration 
    of Rangoon Institute of Technology (RIT) students was brutally cracked down 
    by the ruling authorities led by General Ne Win who took the power by force 
    on 2nd March, 1962. We still remember those days, the days our students fought 
    for democracy, and we remember the death of RIT students and the blood they 
    shed on the street and around the White Bridge beside the Inya Lake. Some 
    of the students were arrested and sent to Insein Prison. Some of them died 
    in prison. Moreover, many innocent people died for democracy during the demonstration 
    in 1988. In retrospect, we all were tired of watching the military government 
    taking every privilege. Students who were fed up with the government and with 
    the mismanagement of education didn't want to take their abuses anymore. As 
    a result, there was a nationwide struggle for democracy and fundamental human 
    rights. People wanted to fight for justice. Unfortunately, too many of us 
    died. Today, it has been for 12 years since the day we were stopped by military 
    government. We need to break down the military government and build a democracy. 
    That begins with our understanding of our history. </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> January 4th 1946, British 
    declared Burma an independent nation. Every year, we commemorate our country's 
    Independence Day because we understand the value of freedom and wish to honor 
    and remember those good citizens, men and women, who gave their lives for 
    the cause. Even though we have Independence Day, we don't really have freedom 
    at all. Only when we have democracy will we have freedom. True independence 
    (freedom) is priceless now. It is something that every citizen is entitled 
    to. Legally, basic human rights that operate as our defense must be equally 
    enjoyed by all. A country in which one group misuses power and oppresses and 
    crushes the people according to its wishes and desires is not a truly independent 
    or free country. Everyone who is a citizen, big or small, far or near, should 
    not suffer discrimination. All will be as of one flesh and one blood. No one 
    will have more. No one will have less, no one will be higher, and no one will 
    be lower. We will be equals. We will not act unjustly to others and will not 
    suffer injustice from others. We will guard freedom with our lives. We will 
    respectfully adhere to our laws. Finally, we will unite as one and march in 
    accordance with the principles laid down by our great leader Bogyoke Aung 
    San who procured independence for us. In order to get democracy all the people 
    must be united and in accord. If united, anything is possible. If disunited, 
    nothing will change. </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> Since an army coup overthrew 
    Burma's last democratically-elected government in 1962, military-run or dominated 
    regimes in Burma have been among the world 's worst violators of human rights. 
    An already serious level of abuses climbed higher after the State Law and 
    Order Restoration Council (SLORC) seized power in September 1988. The Junta 
    removed all pretense of civilian administration and marked its arrival by 
    massacring thousands of unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators in Yangon and 
    other Burmese cities and towns. </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> According to Amnesty International 
    annual reports stated that " In 1988, Burma's army faced allegations of serious 
    human rights abuses, especially in its campaigns against ethnic groups along 
    the country's borders." </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> These gross violations are 
    added to ongoing suppression of other fundamental freedoms. In 1988, a massive 
    and peaceful "people power" movement demanded an end to dictatorship. The 
    army reacted fiercely to preserve its rule. On September 1988, a new junta, 
    the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), seized direct power to 
    quell the democracy movement. Crowds of peaceful protesters were machine-gunned 
    by troops; thousands died. For a few days, events in Burma captured world 
    headlines. </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> As people wanted to fight 
    for justice, Suu was asked to help intermediate between the military regime 
    and the people as the daughter of Burma's most admired independence hero, 
    General Aung San. Despite chaos in the country, people strongly believed that 
    she was the only one who could promote democracy and help create a unity of 
    purpose in the people of Burma. She accepted saying, "As my father's daughter, 
    I felt I had duty to get involved in this struggle,"(Suu 56) after making 
    up her mind to give up her idyllic life at Oxford University. Since then, 
    she has dedicated her life in non-violent movement to bring democracy to the 
    Burmese people. </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> The National league for Democracy 
    became the people's favorite party where Aung San Suu Kyi served as secretary. 
    The NLD party went on to win colossal electoral victory n 1990 taking 392 
    of the 485 seats contested but the military junta refused to transfer power 
    to a civilian government as it had promised. The military government should 
    relinquish their power to the elected part. Instead, They put her under house 
    arrest till today, and arrested students. During this time, she received Nobel 
    Peace Prize. In addition, she has been awarded numerous prestigious international 
    awards for her courageous leadership in a non-violent struggle to bring justice, 
    freedom and democracy to the people of Burma. </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy"> The SLORC pledged that elections 
    would be held after "peace and tranquillity" were restored in Burma. Moreover, 
    the junta's response to the overwhelming defeat was simply to change the rules. 
    It declared the election was not for a parliament, but for some members of 
    a constituent assembly to consider a new constitution. (Suu 89) </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy">Now, the military authorities 
    are claiming that they are working towards democracy- this must be a fantasy. 
    How can authorities who are so afraid to grant basic democratic rights to 
    people build or construct democracy. The fact is that the present military 
    authorities are in great fear of people power. Their minds seem to be set 
    on the idea that only by keeping the people crushed and subjugated they can 
    exist. Such people can never construct democracy. If they had the guts, instead 
    of saying that they are constructing democracy they would be saying " we will 
    never give you democracy'". Suu (95) </span></span> 
  <P> <span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy">"Journal of Law: Equality, 
    Wealth and Political Stability in Burma" reports that " The U.S should also 
    call a session of the U.N Council to pass a resolution condemning Burma's 
    continued failure to transfer to the winners of the 1990 election, and further 
    undermining the State Law and Order Restoration Council's in the eyes of its 
    own people" (Posner 13). </span></span> 
  <P><span class="bodyCopy"><span class="bodyCopy">Burma's political future is 
    now critically poised. There is no doubt that most people in Burma are struggling 
    to survive and need a change. Without transferring the power to the elected 
    party, our country will never reached its development stage. In fact, People 
    of Burma are expecting the help from the International Communities and the 
    United Nations to intermediate the truth about 1990 general election between 
    the elected party and the military government. </span></span><span class="bodyCopy">
